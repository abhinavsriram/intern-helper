United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

Applicants are urged to follow carefully all instructions available in the online recruitment platform, inspira.

Women's Initiative Internship,Center for American Progress,"Washington, DC","Women’s Initiative Internship

Reports to: Director, Women’s Initiative

Department: Women’s Initiative

Position classification: Internship

Location: Virtual

Summary

American Progress has an opening for a virtual summer intern within the Women’s Initiative.
The Women’s Initiative is a comprehensive effort to marshal American Progress’ broad expertise and promote public policies that enable women to participate fully in the nation’s economy and society. Women have made enormous progress over the past 50 years, but workplaces and national policies have yet to adapt to our changing society.

American Progress believes that women—and the challenges they face—must be at the center of our national policy debate in order to develop responsive solutions that improve the lives of women and their families. The Women’s Initiative’s strategy is to put women at the center of the policy agenda and make the case that public policies that help women also strengthen families, workplaces, and the nation. The team arms stakeholders, thought leaders, policymakers, and the public at large with innovative policy ideas and solutions and helps develop both national and on-the-ground strategies to transform these ideas into concrete action. In its work, the Women’s Initiative recognizes, considers, and demonstrates intersections of identity and circumstance, gauging how they shape the challenges women face.

The intern will learn many of the basic skills it takes to be a policy professional at a progressive nonprofit. Primary internship responsibilities include researching issues surrounding women’s economic security, women’s health and rights, and women’s leadership.

Responsibilities
Conduct web-based research for working projects and preliminary research, including research on laws and policies affecting the team’s portfolio.
Draft memos, fact sheets, issue briefs, and talking points that compile and analyze data, original research, and analysis.

Attend virtual meetings, webinars, seminars, hearings, and lectures and report back takeaways.
Assist with administrative tasks such as scheduling appointments, meetings, and conferences.
Perform other duties as assigned.


Requirements And Qualifications
Current pursuance of an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, Juris Doctor, or doctoral degree. Preference may be given to students pursuing an advanced degree.
Excellent research, writing, and editing skills.
General understanding of the current issues surrounding women’s equality and rights, including but not limited to women’s health (including reproductive rights, maternal health, and health care systems broadly) and economic security (including paid leave, equal pay, and broader workplace rights).
Ability to work under pressure and meet tight deadlines.
Outstanding communication and interpersonal skills.
Self-starter who takes initiative and seeks direction as needed.
Thorough knowledge of Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook.
Ability to diagnose problems and identify creative solutions.
Commitment to American Progress’ mission and goals.
