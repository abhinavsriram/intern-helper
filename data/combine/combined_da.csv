You’ll work on data sets ranging from thousands to hundreds of millions of records using modern tools, and develop the skills necessary for extracting meaningful human information from them. You’ll learn how to communicate analytical insights to business stakeholders effectively, as even the most insightful analysis is useless if it isn’t understood by others.

The Role

Partner with Product, Engineering, and Real Estate Operations to analyze the health of our business, identifying and explaining sources of weakness and strength.
Apply the fundamentals of data visualization to build reports that are beautiful, clear, and compelling.
Perform targeted analyses, diving deep to answer broad questions about specific aspects of the business.

A fully paid internship with competitive compensation.
Close mentorship by a senior analyst who will be available for both formal and informal meetings and discussions.
The opportunity to work start to finish on a meaningful analytics project, from deciding on initial data exploration approaches to writing up specific recommendations and presenting them to stakeholders.
