We’re the voice of our customers within Nuna and love learning about their needs and challenges in order to craft better solutions. We thrive in ambiguous situations, manage chaos with a sense of humor, and have a bias towards action that is data‐driven and purposeful.

The Product Management Intern will report to a Senior Product Manager and work closely with User Experience, Engineering, and Data Science to improve existing products and develop new features and capabilities.

This is a high-impact, remote, 12-week paid internship starting in June for students graduating by 2022.
YOUR IMPACT
Nuna was founded to bring accountability to a healthcare system that is currently broken and consistently fails patients across the U.S. When there’s more accountability for the cost and quality of care—when the value of care matters more than the volume of care—patients, payers, and providers stand to benefit.

Our Meaningful Matches product helps health plans connect their members with primary care providers (PCPs) who are available, accessible, and high quality. We do this by deploying our proprietary matching algorithm in a health plan’s existing PCP selection and assignment processes in order to drive better member satisfaction and engagement, and healthcare quality and cost.
YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
You’ll learn from more senior product managers, because we are learners, not knowers, and you’ll have the opportunity to influence them, because growing Nuna’s people is the most reliable way to scale our impact.
You’ll explore and develop novel product solutions as catalysts for healthcare-wide transition to value-based care. We ground decisions in user feedback and rapidly iterate to ensure that we’re addressing the problems we aim to solve.
You’ll work as part of a team, not in a silo. At Nuna we rise by lifting up others.
You’ll work cross functionally with design, data science, engineering and customer implementation to deliver a data-driven and user-first experience.
You’ll work closely with other interns and participate in resume and career planning workshops throughout the duration of your internship.
YOU BRING
Exceptional communication and listening skills - you break down problems and generate shared understanding across technical and non-technical audiences.
Attention to detail and ability to document product and business needs across multiple stakeholders. You are user-obsessed and can translate their needs into product requirements
Desire to learn the ins and outs of a product to measurably improve it.
Get-it-done personality with a bias towards testing and execution.
Prior experience or interest in working on healthcare analytics products and the opportunities and challenges of building them to scale.
Entrepreneurial, leadership, and/or organizational dynamic skills.
Ability to collaborate on a roadmap to prioritize competing demands across multiple stakeholders.
2+ years of relevant professional, volunteer, and/or academic experience.
BONUSES
Prior experience working on healthcare analytics products.
Proven track record of launching enterprise products in the analytics or healthcare space.
Experience working with teams of engineers and data scientists.

We’re driven by people who have a passion for technology and innovation; we are a fun, results-driven company that thrives on delivering value to customers and making a difference in the world leveraging our solutions. If this sounds like you, come join our herd!

At LLamasoft, our mission is to elevate lives and organizations through the science of smarter decision-making. Powered by AI and advanced analytics, our enterprise decision platform enables business leaders to solve problems in new ways and make smarter decisions faster as their business and operating models change. We are pioneering the use of a true digital twin of the extended supply chain combined with our powerful algorithms and deep supply chain, data engineering, AI and operational expertise. LLamasoft deploys decision solutions through enterprise ready apps, custom apps, and an extensible no-code App Studio.

 

The Role:

There will be two Product Management Interns. One will work to identify data streams that can help customers predict demand which can be incorporated in Demand Suite of products. This intern will also create sanitized customer time series information that can be used for future research and QA purposes.

The second intern in this role will work to improve the current template apps through user research and customer extension. They will deliver new apps in areas where customers have created apps to solve their own problems which could be more broadly applicable.

 

Project Opportunities: Examples

Project 1: As an intern on this project, you will spend the first two weeks learning demand guru (self-paced) and collect customer data and product characteristics from current customers. During the second four weeks, you procure sample data from different data streams (from customers for data like IDC and from vendors for other data) and do analysis to pick data that should be procured to be made part of the product by specific industries. There will be a presentation at the end of the project to the audience on what showed high correlation and what did we learn from those that can be applied for the future.

Project 2: As an intern on this project, you will spend the first two weeks learning app builder and current set of apps. During the next two weeks you will take an app that has been prioritized and work with UX and users to do user experience research and improve the template app. During the last two weeks you will create a new template app from scratch based on a customer business problem that has been prioritized as broadly useful and impactful. At the end of the project, you will present what you have learned and demonstrate the new template app and the improved template app.

 

The Qualifications:

Strong and demonstrated desire to learn
Pursuing an undergraduate degree, preferably with a data analytics, business, or UX background
Be self-motivated and detail oriented.
Ability to work in a fast-paced dynamic work environment.
Strong analytical abilities to convert business requirements into actionable work
