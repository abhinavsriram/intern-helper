We are looking for interns with an educational focus on strategy, research and branding. Strategy interns will be exposed to different WONGDOODY offerings, from digital and physical experience strategies to brand positioning and marketing campaigns.

Gather client background information to fill in information gaps related to client briefs
Track and summarize secondary research (competitive, category and cultural trends) and share learnings and perspectives
Support strategists in leading workshops and internal discussion
Assist in implementing and analyzing qualitative and quantitative research (Motherboard, Sounding Board) to improve our understanding of people, their attitudes, behaviors barriers

You're smart. You're insatiably curious. You're a big thinker. You want to help create great work for our clients.
You're comfortable with cultural analysis and data-driven storytelling and killed at distilling large bodies of knowledge down to the most salient points.
You find inspiration easily – especially in the humans you meet. The culture of the place you work matters to you as much as the work itself.
You've got a big sense of humor and a small ego.


a Few Other Important Things To Note
For full consideration please upload both a resume and cover letter. In your cover letter be sure to cover why you are interested in WONGDOODY and the strategy internship as well as three to five bullet points detailing what you want to achieve during your Wongternship.
We'd like to see how you think. In addition to your resume and cover letter, your application should include a link to a portfolio or to at least two writing samples or presentation decks.
We thrive on a culture that is equal parts talent plus really good, genuine people. If that describes you, we think you'll be happy to be surrounded by our amazing team.

For candidates chosen for an interview, we'll get back to you to let you know about next steps.

2021 Summer Internship - Creative Intern,RAPP,"New York, NY","Who We Are

We think too much marketing isn't us. It's mass markets not audiences of one. Homogenous groups to be targeted, not individuals to be inspired. Segments to reach, not people with their own ideas and ambitions. It's one size fits all and it's dull.

When it comes to individuals, we're fierce. We stand up for individuality. We speak up against bland, broad-brush generalizations. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual's needs, beliefs, behaviors and aspirations. And we commit to doing this in every aspect of our work for clients and their consumers.

We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency's vision. And most importantly we value every individual's wellbeing.

We are Fiercely Individual.

As a guiding ethos, RAPP stands up for Individuality. So much so, that it's in our agency value proposition. We're committed to racial justice, equality, representation and unbiased economic opportunity, because we know that the strength of our diversity helps us create our best work. And we believe in harnessing the strength of all our Fiercely Individual people, and the differences among us, because that's the surest way to positively impact our business and network culture.

How We Do It

At RAPP, we are fiercely focused on the individual and how we can create value from every individual's experience with a brand. We do this across three capability areas: customer centric consulting, creativity that inspires action, and customer experience management.
