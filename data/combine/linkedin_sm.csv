CNET Social Media Intern: 2021,Red Ventures,"Charlotte, NC","At a Glance

CNET is looking for Social Media Intern to join the team to help with our day-to-day coverage across numerous channels. This intern will get the opportunity to work closely with members of the social team as they build content, execute on platform strategies and report on results, while also collaborating with our editorial and video teams to get (virtual) newsroom and studio experiences as they expand their skillset and build their portfolio for future opportunities.

What You'll Do
Learn what it's like to work on the social team within the world's leading tech news publisher.
Help manage CNET's flagship accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
Experiment on newer platforms like TikTok and Clubhouse, and new features on established platforms.
Get experience crafting language, still assets and video for various audience needs across those aforementioned platforms. You'll get to write posts, craft threads, sculpt scripts, design Instagram posts, shoot Reels and much, much more.
Learn the basics of metrics and reporting and how to use data to identify successes and failures, and how to learn from them.
Discover and pitch ideas not just within the social team, but within editorial and video as well.
Learn from social teams beyond CNET within the RV portfolio like GameSpot, Healthline and The Points Guy.


What We're Looking For
Graduating Winter 2021 or Summer 2022
A team member who's enthusiastic about the digital media landscape and willing to bring new ideas to the table.
Someone interested in what makes a social media team tick, whether it's to further a career in journalism, marketing or more broadly in digital media.
Experience writing and to a lesser degree editing creative, effective copy, whether in prior internships, jobs or classwork. If you thrived in Media Writing classes, that's a great start.
Familiarity with newsgathering and reporting, AP Style and other principles of journalism.
An interest in the intersection between technology and all other parts of life — you'll be bored if things like the impact of algorithms on labor movements or what makes a new iPhone unique don't excite you.
