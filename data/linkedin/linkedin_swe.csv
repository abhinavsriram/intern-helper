Product Software Engineer Fall 2021 Internship (Meraki),Cisco,"San Francisco, CA","Product Software Engineer

Fall Internship (August 2021 - December, full-time work schedule, Monday- Friday 40 hours per week)

The modern world runs on the Internet, and the Internet cannot exist without its underlying infrastructure.

Meraki enables connectivity everywhere from neighborhood cafes to elite universities to global hospitality groups operating thousands of sites.

As a Product Software Engineer at Meraki, you will bring life to our products, imbuing them with what some call the Meraki Magic. Through your contributions, you will enable our customers to do more things more easily than ever before. You will have opportunities to work across our stack, developing software ranging from bootloaders, device drivers, and routing code to our distributed, cloud-hosted backend.

Here are some of the projects you might find yourself working on
Designing and implementing (usually in C/C++) features to improve the reliability, simplicity, and performance of our devices, as well as make them more flexible and powerful
Bringing up our Linux-based system on new hardware platforms
Collaborating with our hardware engineers on the design of new platforms
You’re the kind of person we’re looking for if
BA/BS in Computer Science, ECE, EE, ME or STEM related field (in progress)

You have worked with Linux on embedded platforms
You have an understanding of OS fundamentals and experience working in both kernel and user space
You love being a part of a tight-knit, hard-working team and want to have an impact with your own work while also elevating your teammates

At Meraki, you will have the opportunity to explore multiple technology areas and problem domains. Whether you have a passion for user interfaces, distributed systems, network protocols, or embedded development — or perhaps more than one of these — you will be able to dive deep here. Together with your team you will craft from top to bottom the suite of innovative products that make Meraki unique.

Intern Program Overview

Meraki interns and co-ops join the team for 12 and 16 week programs, respectively, and are placed directly onto subteams. During the program, interns/co-ops have the opportunity to work on a small starter project, such as integration and implementation of new tools, before spending the bulk of the program on a larger project, such as building the infrastructure for a new service. Projects are multi-functional, which allow insight into new languages and technologies, help encourage professional growth within engineering, and allow a sense of ownership within the team.

Meraki’s engineering teams place a high emphasis on mentorship. Each intern and co-op is matched 11 with a mentor who provides continual feedback and guidance throughout the duration of the program. Mentors help with introductions to other team members, overviews of tools and processes, and provide a seamless integration into Meraki life.
