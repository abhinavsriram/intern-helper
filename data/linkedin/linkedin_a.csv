Interns learn to follow workflows and prioritize their tasks based on urgency and importance.
Interns are responsible for specific tasks provided by direct supervisors and check in with more experienced colleagues or their manager when they are unsure or unable to make a decision or solve a problem.
The problems that interns solve are directly related to the project that they have been assigned.
Interns support their teammates by completing assigned tasks on time, helping others, and communicating about their workload with their manager.
