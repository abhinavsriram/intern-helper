TL;DR: Fast-growing early-stage startup seeking Operations Intern. In doing so, we’ll empower the most ambitious people in the world to build the future. Details below!

About On Deck

On Deck is where ambitious people grow, together.

On Deck is where the world's top talent comes to connect. Whatever it is our fellows want to do next, our ever-growing community and action-oriented programming will help them get there—fast. If our fellows want to learn something new to up-level their career, launch and scale big ideas, or make lifelong friends, this is the place.

Role Overview

Punchline: We're looking for all-star operations interns to help our Program Directors launch and run our new Fellowship programs .

You may have seen, we're launching a lot of new Fellowship programs ! :) Each one becomes a critical piece of the interweaving flywheel of products we're building at On Deck.

When considering launching new programs, we ask ourselves: does this make the broader On Deck ecosystem stronger, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts?

For every program we've launched thus far, we see the potential for it to become a multi-million dollar business line.

We're looking for operations interns to help our Operations Generalists and Program Directors bring their programs from 0 to 1.

Responsibilities

Programs don't happen without the Operations team executing on every last detail — that's where you come in.

You’ll work directly with a Program Director from On Deck Labs, the Operations Generalist, and Regina Gerbeaux (Head of Fellowship Operations) on all things operations-related.

On this team, you'll work on the program structure, events & opportunities we offer to Fellows.

We’re looking for a force of nature; someone who will do whatever it takes — both strategically & tactically — to make a massive positive impact on our fellows' lives.

This is an incredibly exciting role, with lots of opportunities to learn, get your hands dirty, take on lots of responsibility from Day One, and bring something from a mere concept into a full-fledged profitable business unit.

The team is growing extremely fast, so you'll get an inside seat at a company in rapid scaling mode.

As such, we're also looking to hire for these roles ASAP. If you're ready to move fast, so are we. Let's chat.

Who You Are
High output, execution, and hustle – an ability to own all operations, and an eagerness to dive into the nitty-gritty
Passionate about startups & constantly learning about tech.
Thrives in a fast-paced, often scrappy, sometimes chaotic environment.
Natural community-builder – understands the long-game, and how to cultivate positive-sum value.
Has a strong ""spirit of service"", where you think first how you can give rather than take, and always seeking opportunities to support Fellows to the max of your ability.
Serious about inclusion and creating a safe & welcoming space for all members of our community.
Meticulously detail-oriented and organized – able to juggle many priorities while not dropping any balls.
Great interpersonal skills, charisma, and enjoys building new relationships.
Strong communication skills - verbal, written and presentation.
Our team lives and breathes Slack & Zoom — our fellowships' central gathering places are a highly active Slack community & a lively calendar of Zoom events. We're looking for team members who are comfortable with both tools or can ramp up quickly. Other tools you should be familiar with or ready to ramp up on include Zapier and Airtable.

What You Will Do
We treat interns the same as full-timers and give you an immense amount of autonomy, responsibility and impact.
You will work on everything Ops including:
Fellowship Programming Calendar — everything from designing the experience to booking guests to hosting interviews).
New events & initiatives — design & launch experiments to help fellows work together, learn from each other, and connect).
Sweat the small stuff — ensuring we give fellows & speakers a highly professional experience with every last detail prepared, from intro email to thank-you message.
Event execution — manage all event logistics, communications, and details with a strong attention to detail.
Build dozens (maybe hundreds) of new relationships, connections, and an experience that is truly one-of-a-kind connecting top technology Founders & Investors with Fellows from around the world.
You'll work within our no-code stack to set up automations, infrastructure, and landing pages for new programs (we'll help you learn, if you aren't already familiar)
Create the conditions such that each Program Director is set up to create incredible new Fellowships, while also ensuring Fellows have a mind-blowing experience, unlike any other community they've ever been part of.
Assist Program Director in coordinating with the tech ecosystem at large to provide world-class programming and mentorship – building relationships with fellows, guest speakers, event partners, and more.
Ultimately, ensuring fellows have a mind-blowing experience unlike any other community they've ever been part of.
The Labs team will be here for you. Any question, any ask, any meeting, anything you need — we will block time to make it happen.

Why Might Excite You About Us
We’re tackling a big problem with even bigger potential. Participants in our existing Fellowships say great things about us .
You’ll be able to work remotely and (mostly) set your own schedule. On Deck was a remote-first team even before COVID, so we know what makes for a great remote environment.
You'll have a lot of flexibility in your role, and will be able to help define what our operations infrastructure looks like going forward.
We're backed by a who’s who of the biggest names in the venture investing world, including Village Global, Keith Rabois, Balaji Srinivasan, Bloomberg Beta, and so many more. (Read more about our fundraise and 50-year vision here .)

Why you might *not* be excited about us:
We are still a fairly young company with about 100 people, so if you like more established companies, this role isn’t for you. You'll help create our company's culture.
We're an early stage startup. Projects and priorities are likely to shift.
Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to push towards our lofty ambitions. Most people won’t be cut out for it.
You should be comfortable with just a dash of chaos. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day.
On Deck is an unabashedly pro-startup, pro-tech organization. If that’s not your thing, this isn’t the place for you.

Location, start date and compensation:

This is a paid, full-time internship for 3 months. Start date is flexible, but we prioritize folks who are ready to start ASAP.

Our team works remotely, but you will have to be available to work on U.S.-friendly hours, which may be difficult from Europe or Asia.

Our program includes some weekend and evening events, which you would be expected to attend.

You would start as soon as possible.

Important

Please note, the application questions are the most important part of this application. We will be reviewing them closely to determine who will move on in our hiring process. Please answer thoughtfully and take your time.

Summary

In summary, On Deck may not be the place for you if

If you were to join On Deck, we'd want you to love it. We also know that it can be hard to tell from the outside looking in whether that would be the case for you. So, we challenged ourselves to develop an honest set of reasons someone wouldn't want to join our company . We hope it helps you make an informed decision about whether On Deck is a place you'd love to work.

Another company's mission gets you way more fired up.
You want a 9-5 job.
You do your best work in highly-structured, steady-paced, and meticulously-planned environments.
You like finding and poking holes more than you like filling them.
You see differences as divisions.

Strategy & Operations Internship Summer 2021 (Remote),Enova International,"Chicago, IL","About the role:

As a Strategy & Operations intern, you will directly support one of Enova's core P&Ls and tackle projects that ensure Enova is operating at peak performance, and continuously improving so our customers can have the best possible experience. Over a period of 8-10 weeks, you will partake in projects that can range from short-term immediate impact projects, like automating a business process, to long term strategic initiatives, such as a new product launch. The best part? Our team is big enough to have the resources to successfully scale the business, but small enough that a single intern has the autonomy to make a meaningful impact. That means you can make your mark.

As a member of the Enova internship program, you will have the benefit of networking with other interns across the company through virtual team outings, lunches, and events.

We're excited about you if you have:

Been working toward undergraduate or master's degree in Industrial Engineering, Finance, or other quantitative degrees, or equivalent experience.
Excellent written and oral communication skills.
High energy, team player, creative thinker, and strategic influencer.
Demonstrated experience in working with broad cross-functional teams.
Skilled in negotiating, influencing others, analytical thinking, leading others, and executing and implementing projects.
Willingness to learn and work in a hands-on environment.
Advanced Excel modeling experience required. Prefer proficiency with SQL.

Our Strategy & Operations Team:

Enova's Strategy & Operation teams - or ""S&O"" as insiders commonly refer to them here - drive the business at both the operational and business levels. In addition to working cross functionally on the corporate side, S&Os work closely with our call center operations (think application support, loan processing, collections or customer service) to ensure optimization and anticipate any bumps in the road. To do this, they dive deeper into our existing processes and ask themselves lots of questions like, why are we doing this that way? Why don't we try this? And, likely the most important question, how is this going to affect the bottom line of our business?

Social Media Marketing Intern,PathMatch,Los Angeles Metropolitan Area,"Are you interested in a career in Digital Marketing with a focus on Social Media Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing. This matched internship has a larger emphasis on Social Media Marketing. Students will be focused on both organic and paid social.

Most students don’t realize how critical corporate internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing or Social Media Marketing skills in a classroom. Companies look for experience working on live campaigns.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where you'll learn the fundamentals of digital marketing and get matched to an internship with our corporate partner where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.

IN-21045 Food Loss & Waste Schools & Supply Chain Intern,World Wildlife Fund,"Washington, DC","World Wildlife Fund (WWF), one of the world’s leading conservation organizations, seeks an intern for its initiatives focused on reducing food loss and waste across supply chains and in schools within the Food Waste program.

The production and consumption of food constitutes the biggest environmental threat to our planet. Eliminating waste and shifting consumption patterns represents our biggest opportunity to establish sustainable and regenerative food systems. Addressing food waste across food supply chains (from farm, to field, to landfill) is not only critical for the environment, but also companies’ financial sustainability.

WWF’s Food Waste program has worked to standardize FLW measurement across the value chain—from farms and suppliers to restaurants, hospitality businesses, food retailers, and schools. Through its No Food Left Behind initiative, WWF quantifies on-farm post-harvest loss for specialty crops and has developed a food loss metric for growers.

Through its Food Waste Warrior initiative, WWF has additionally developed research, curriculum guides, and grant programs to help schools turn cafeterias into classrooms; engage students around food loss and waste; and ultimately measure and reduce food waste in schools across the US.

By starting with measurement, better data and understanding of the drivers behind FLW will inevitably set in motion innovation and targeted intervention strategies to reduce it. The ultimate goal is to help instill principles and practices to prevent FLW, in order to lower food costs and maximize water, greenhouse gas, and land use reductions.

This position offers a unique educational experience to gain experience in working with key stakeholders across the food supply chain, with a specific focus on food waste prevention and recovery. Candidates will be prioritized who are looking to further their career in sustainable food systems and/or education. This role will work directly with the Director and the senior staff of the Food Waste program to support project management, communication, research, content development, and new pilot projects for its schools, farms, and supply chain initiatives.

Specific Duties May Include
Project and relationship management support - Assisting relationship management and communication activities, including project management support of major initiatives with partners, peer NGOs, government agencies, teachers, schools, and other key internal and external partners.
External meeting support - Attending calls and meetings with WWF staff and external partners, compiling notes as necessary and summarizing action items in collaboration with Supervisor.
Research - Conducting internal research and literature reviews to the Food Waste team, and also supporting the writing and research of any external facing reports for publication or project deliverables.
Content development - Aiding the creation and improvement of materials like presentations and slide decks, reports, talking points, blog posts, case studies, digital content, and social media copy.
Data analysis - Analyzing data from multiple sources including weights & measures from food waste pilot programs.
Identifies and aligns with the core values of the WWF organization Courage, Integrity, Respect & Collaboration
Able to commit to 40 hours/week for at least 6 months (with opportunity for extension to 1 year)
Experience in farm/agricultural or education sectors preferred (but not required)
Must have very strong proficiency with the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook), and creating customer-facing presentations
Experience with Airtable preferred (but not required)
Data analysis experience preferred
Proactive and creative problem-solving
Strong writing skills
Strong research and analytical skills, as well as attention to detail are obligatory
Ability to work productively on both independent research assignments and as part of a team
Fluency in English is required
Applicants from nontraditional career paths, transitioning into this field, and pursuing higher education degrees are encouraged to apply.

With Regards To Our Values And Commitment To DEI, The Following Are Excerpts From WWF Freshwater & Food’s Statement On Justice, Equity, Diversity, And Inclusion
Diversity is an essential element to a thriving, functional ecosystem, just as it is to humanity—diversity enables innovation, complexity, beauty, wonder, and resilience.
The long history of discrimination, prejudice and exploitation of differences, in the United States and around the world, has led to deeply embedded injustices and inequalities in structures, institutions, and mindsets (both conscious and unconscious) that must be acknowledged and addressed to advance justice and equity today.
We commit to a culture of learning and growth, in which we strive to understand and address our intrinsic biases and inspire our colleagues to do the same. This commitment includes being self-reflective, open to respectful and constructive feedback, and eager to learn about areas of growth and improvement. We commit to fostering space internally to facilitate courageous conversations in a safe, compassionate, and respectful way.
We commit to leverage our position as conservationists and conveners to elevate, make space for, and emphasize historically underrepresented voices and perspectives with humility, openness to learning and recognition of complexity and nuance, especially related to culture and power dynamics.

Tile’s Mission

We solve real problems with technology to make people’s daily lives better.

At Tile, we recognize that daily life is challenging. We lead busy lives filled with family, friends, jobs, pets, and other things we love. Balancing this can be demanding, unpredictable and stressful.

We use technology to solve real everyday problems that keep each day running smoothly. People rely on Tile to be a seamless part of their lives whether they are at home or out in the world.

By helping to make daily lives easier, we free people to find their best lives — whatever that means to them. Tile is for everyone, on every platform, everywhere in the world. Tile for life.

About Tile

Tile is best known today for its market-leading Bluetooth finders with over 35 million units sold and ~5M items located daily. That said, Tile has recently expanded the devices that are findable by its platform by embedding its software into third-party products.

Over 30 billion Bluetooth devices are shipping over the next 5 years and each of these can be Tile-enabled with a software update. Partnerships have been announced with HP for laptops, leading audio headset OEMs like Bose and SkullCandy, and several others. Tile also has a large portfolio of unannounced OEM partnerships with top brands in many other large verticals (e.g. wearables, bikes, etc.) and is integrating its technology on the Bluetooth chips to make the Tile enablement more seamless for these partners (e.g. Tile has a partnership with Intel for PCs).

In addition to the OEM and chip partnerships, Tile is scaling its finding network by entering into access point partnerships with companies like Google, Amazon, and Comcast (all announced and ongoing).

From a business model perspective, Tile is shifting the relationship with its customers from a transactional device sale to offering a long-term, high-value service. Tile introduced its premium service two years ago and has ~400K subscribers today with a specific focus on growing annual recurring revenue.

We are guided by our company values, which are Start with Trust, Bring It, Build What Matters, Better Together, and Power What’s Next. Recently accredited as a Great Place to Work, we are a high-performing team and our leaders consider themselves to be performance coaches with a primary responsibility of accelerating Tile’s success and that of their teammates. We know that the more our consumers win, the more we win, and we love working with like-minded teammates to do just that.

Marketing Intern,Ironic,"Boston, MA","Company Description

Ironic Music Booking Agency is the most innovative booking agency on the New England music scene. We handle a wide array of artists and are confident that we can provide the perfect entertainment for any venue or situation. We pride ourselves in differentiating from the ‘average’ booking agent in that we focus a great deal of attention on the social media marketing of all the gigs we book.

Ironic Music Booking Agency began over 10 years ago. Early on, we realized that there were many small to medium sized venues who were interested in live entertainment but they either didn't have sufficient space/need for a larger formation, or lacked sufficient budget, or both. Ironic naturally migrated to this niche market and has since, almost by default, specialized in acoustic music, boasting the largest roster of acoustic acts in New England.

Job Description

The Marketing Intern will primarily be responsible for researching and targeting potential new markets for Ironic, from marketing to lead generation to marketing materials. His/her foremost priorities are as follows:
Conduct research into pre-determined new markets, primarily in the New England area (MA, NH, ME, CT, VT, RI)
Research the markets to their fullest extent including competition.
Build a detailed database of the targeted markets.
Assist in the development of marketing materials for this market, as well as review/generate new e-marketing ideas for Client.
Assist Client overall in generating new business, which includes but is not limited to identifying new venues, in Client’s aforementioned area; researching contact info; et. al.
The intern may also be requested to participate in the following tasks, on an as-needed/if available basis:
Assist in drafting/writing band promo sheets and marketing copy for e-mail blasts and websites, based on Client’s standard format.
Update/improve a detailed database of artists which Client represents, including all of their updated info. Gather necessary promo information on artists to be used in marketing, promotion and/or other.
Research new markets where Client could potentially propose her musicians/bands to perform (mainly in New England).
Intern will also be responsible in assisting the Client in discovering, soliciting and signing musicians to be booked as well as participate in and learn about contract negotiation with the bands to be signed. Client is by no means obligated to consider, accept and sign the bands/musicians which Music Booking Intern presents.
Post a brief description of gigs as booked by Client on-line, to a number of websites. List to be provided by Client. Intern may also be asked to assist in researching additional sites to promote Client’s gigs and/or services.
Fill-in online forms in order to generate buzz and get the Clients’ musicians’ gigs promoted in the most efficient, effective and timely manner possible.
The Client is in no means restricted to requesting only the aforementioned duties of the Intern insomuch as they are related to the overall goals of the Client in booking music talent to various venues, festivals, coffee houses, community events, private parties, etc.

Qualifications

College seniors or graduate students with a marketing related major and some experience researching new markets and building databases.

Requirements
Self-driven and proactive.
Experience with marketing, market research, and market analysis.
Excellent organizational skills and use of Excel/Word required.
Ability to prioritize and to meet tight deadlines.
Willingness to ask questions and seek help when needed.

Data Service Operations Intern,ASML,"San Diego, CA","Introduction
ASML US, including its affiliates and subsidiaries, bring together the most creative minds in science and technology to develop lithography machines that are key to producing faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient microchips. We design, develop, integrate, market and service these advanced machines, which enable our customers - the world’s leading chipmakers - to reduce the size and increase the functionality of their microchips, which in turn leads to smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. Our headquarters are in Veldhoven, Netherlands, and we have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Chandler, Arizona, San Jose and San Diego, California, Wilton, Connecticut, and Hillsboro, Oregon.
Job Mission
In the CLS division in San Diego, we design and manufacture Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lasers, used directly in the chipmaking process. Far from a basic “consumer” laser, these machines are complex, powerful, and flexible. The lasers we make require durable and high-speed precise motion-controlled optics to maintain wavelength to femtometer accuracy under high laser powers; advanced materials to endure the harsh Fluorine-rich environments and high powers; clever mechanical designs to allow high performance and fit all the parts within a confined space, but still allow easy manufacturing and servicing; very fast high power electronics and electrical designs to deliver short high voltage pulses at precise timing to control pulse energy within hundredths of a percent; gas flows at hurricane speeds to keep the laser discharge area clear; cutting edge controllers and algorithms to deliver stable and consistent performance and automate all operations; and advanced real-time electronics, firmware and software to control the laser and interact with other equipment. The laser needs to minimize use of expensive or rare resources like energy or Neon gas. It needs to actively control temperatures, pressures, gas concentrations and voltages precisely to maintain good performance. It must react instantly to changing customer demands and environmental conditions. And it needs to do all of this, operating continuously and reliably for months while producing billions of perfect light pulses, without any human intervention or downtime.

Solving these challenges requires expertise in system engineering, optics, physics, controls, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, test engineering, embedded software and firmware, manufacturing, industrialization, and more. If you like extreme challenges and want to help bring the next generation of technology to the world, then come join ASML

This position may require access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R.
730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require the Company to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.

Job Description

Project Galileo : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

Athenian Project : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

And more women say they speak out against women's abuse: 26% report having publicly spoken in the last 6 months against physically abusing women.

Summer Camp Operations Intern,Galileo Learning,"San Francisco, CA","US-CA-San Francisco - Noe Valley

Are you a college or high school student ready to demonstrate your skills in a job that helps you gain great experience? Love doing whatever it takes and performing a variety of tasks? Want to have an incredibly fun, unforgettable summer? Consider a role at our newly redesigned, COVID-safe camp—same joyful Galileo vibe, with thoughtful new safety precautions for all.

About Galileo

Galileo’s mission is to develop innovators who envision and create a better world. We know it’s bold. We also know that we can’t achieve it without asking staff to be role models of an innovator’s mindset—visionary, courageous, collaborative, determined, and reflective. It’s not always easy. Camp staffers work hard and bring camp magic to life—for campers, and for themselves.

This isn’t your average summer teaching gig. Galileans are expected to take ownership of their own performance and make this place better every day. People with a can-do attitude thrive here and those with a victim mentality don't. We manage to keep this level of performance expectation high in a relaxed environment; we take our work, not ourselves, seriously.

Galileans know what it means to be a vital part of a team. Galileans want to grow. Galileans like to have fun at work. Galileans love sharing in—and helping to create—joyful experiences. After all, we run summer camps. You get the point.

We value having divergent thinkers who bring various experiences and viewpoints to the table at Galileo. We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.

Program Description

Due to COVID-19, our traditional Camp Galileo model has been reimagined for Summer 2021 and replaced with a new structure focused on camper safety and joy, featuring stable groups of 12 campers (that remain physically distanced from other groups), and consistent staff for each week-long session. Each group will rotate between three assigned spaces (primarily outdoors) and a home base where campers can spread out and partake in the day's activities. Campers will play fun games and engage in hands-on activities that encourage them to learn via our unique pedagogy—the Galileo Innovation Approach (or the GIA).

Position Overview

Galileo would not function without Summer Interns. Their ability to switch focus from week to week, day to day, hour to hour, and sometimes minute to minute is critical to the successful operation of camp. This role requires a positive, solution-oriented attitude, initiative, flexibility, and exceptional service mentality. And in the new iteration of our classic Summer Intern role, you’ll have the opportunity to level up professionally, participate in the scaling of our exciting new in-person camp models, and greater responsibility over administrative tasks (like lesson materials prep and surface sanitization).

What You’ll Get

Purposeful work on an innovative team, along with the opportunity to expand upon or develop hands-on program iteration skills. Plus, you’ll be a part of a supportive community that stands for innovation, credibility, and expertise. We’re a certified B Corporation that is ranked #1 on the Best Places to Work in the Bay Area list, were named one of Forbes’ Best Small Companies and a Top 100 Impact Company, and are authentically committed to inclusion and equity company-wide—which includes joyfully upholding a robust financial assistance program.

SHARED VALUES AND EXPECTATIONS
Serve as an ambassador of Galileo, demonstrating our mission and values in a positive and professional manner and acting as a role model of the Galileo Innovator’s Mindset
Commit to building a safe, child-focused community
Demonstrate professionalism and accountability
Take initiative to analyze and solve problems
Treat others with courtesy and respect

Athenian Project : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever.

Summer Camp Operations Intern,Galileo Learning,"Burlingame, CA","US-CA-Burlingame

Are you a college or high school student ready to demonstrate your skills in a job that helps you gain great experience? Love doing whatever it takes and performing a variety of tasks? Want to have an incredibly fun, unforgettable summer? Consider a role at our newly redesigned, COVID-safe camp—same joyful Galileo vibe, with thoughtful new safety precautions for all.

About Galileo

Galileo’s mission is to develop innovators who envision and create a better world. We know it’s bold. We also know that we can’t achieve it without asking staff to be role models of an innovator’s mindset—visionary, courageous, collaborative, determined, and reflective. It’s not always easy. Camp staffers work hard and bring camp magic to life—for campers, and for themselves.

This isn’t your average summer teaching gig. Galileans are expected to take ownership of their own performance and make this place better every day. People with a can-do attitude thrive here and those with a victim mentality don't. We manage to keep this level of performance expectation high in a relaxed environment; we take our work, not ourselves, seriously.

Galileans know what it means to be a vital part of a team. Galileans want to grow. Galileans like to have fun at work. Galileans love sharing in—and helping to create—joyful experiences. After all, we run summer camps. You get the point.

We value having divergent thinkers who bring various experiences and viewpoints to the table at Galileo. We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.

Program Description

Due to COVID-19, our traditional Camp Galileo model has been reimagined for Summer 2021 and replaced with a new structure focused on camper safety and joy, featuring stable groups of 12 campers (that remain physically distanced from other groups), and consistent staff for each week-long session. Each group will rotate between three assigned spaces (primarily outdoors) and a home base where campers can spread out and partake in the day's activities. Campers will play fun games and engage in hands-on activities that encourage them to learn via our unique pedagogy—the Galileo Innovation Approach (or the GIA).

Position Overview

Galileo would not function without Summer Interns. Their ability to switch focus from week to week, day to day, hour to hour, and sometimes minute to minute is critical to the successful operation of camp. This role requires a positive, solution-oriented attitude, initiative, flexibility, and exceptional service mentality. And in the new iteration of our classic Summer Intern role, you’ll have the opportunity to level up professionally, participate in the scaling of our exciting new in-person camp models, and greater responsibility over administrative tasks (like lesson materials prep and surface sanitization).

What You’ll Get

Purposeful work on an innovative team, along with the opportunity to expand upon or develop hands-on program iteration skills. Plus, you’ll be a part of a supportive community that stands for innovation, credibility, and expertise. We’re a certified B Corporation that is ranked #1 on the Best Places to Work in the Bay Area list, were named one of Forbes’ Best Small Companies and a Top 100 Impact Company, and are authentically committed to inclusion and equity company-wide—which includes joyfully upholding a robust financial assistance program.

Summer Camp Operations Intern,Galileo Learning,"Sunnyvale, CA","US-CA-Sunnyvale

Are you a college or high school student ready to demonstrate your skills in a job that helps you gain great experience? Love doing whatever it takes and performing a variety of tasks? Want to have an incredibly fun, unforgettable summer? Consider a role at our newly redesigned, COVID-safe camp—same joyful Galileo vibe, with thoughtful new safety precautions for all.

About Galileo

Galileo’s mission is to develop innovators who envision and create a better world. We know it’s bold. We also know that we can’t achieve it without asking staff to be role models of an innovator’s mindset—visionary, courageous, collaborative, determined, and reflective. It’s not always easy. Camp staffers work hard and bring camp magic to life—for campers, and for themselves.

This isn’t your average summer teaching gig. Galileans are expected to take ownership of their own performance and make this place better every day. People with a can-do attitude thrive here and those with a victim mentality don't. We manage to keep this level of performance expectation high in a relaxed environment; we take our work, not ourselves, seriously.

Galileans know what it means to be a vital part of a team. Galileans want to grow. Galileans like to have fun at work. Galileans love sharing in—and helping to create—joyful experiences. After all, we run summer camps. You get the point.

We value having divergent thinkers who bring various experiences and viewpoints to the table at Galileo. We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.

Program Description

Due to COVID-19, our traditional Camp Galileo model has been reimagined for Summer 2021 and replaced with a new structure focused on camper safety and joy, featuring stable groups of 12 campers (that remain physically distanced from other groups), and consistent staff for each week-long session. Each group will rotate between three assigned spaces (primarily outdoors) and a home base where campers can spread out and partake in the day's activities. Campers will play fun games and engage in hands-on activities that encourage them to learn via our unique pedagogy—the Galileo Innovation Approach (or the GIA).

Position Overview

Galileo would not function without Summer Interns. Their ability to switch focus from week to week, day to day, hour to hour, and sometimes minute to minute is critical to the successful operation of camp. This role requires a positive, solution-oriented attitude, initiative, flexibility, and exceptional service mentality. And in the new iteration of our classic Summer Intern role, you’ll have the opportunity to level up professionally, participate in the scaling of our exciting new in-person camp models, and greater responsibility over administrative tasks (like lesson materials prep and surface sanitization).

What You’ll Get

Purposeful work on an innovative team, along with the opportunity to expand upon or develop hands-on program iteration skills. Plus, you’ll be a part of a supportive community that stands for innovation, credibility, and expertise. We’re a certified B Corporation that is ranked #1 on the Best Places to Work in the Bay Area list, were named one of Forbes’ Best Small Companies and a Top 100 Impact Company, and are authentically committed to inclusion and equity company-wide—which includes joyfully upholding a robust financial assistance program.

SHARED VALUES AND EXPECTATIONS
Serve as an ambassador of Galileo, demonstrating our mission and values in a positive and professional manner and acting as a role model of the Galileo Innovator’s Mindset

Take initiative to analyze and solve problems
