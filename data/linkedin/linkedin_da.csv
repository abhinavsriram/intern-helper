We’ve got all the perks, but if what you value most is doing great work in a creative, collaborative, and disciplined environment, join us.

As a Data Analyst Intern, you’ll use some of the most robust real estate search and customer activity data in the world to build tools and answer questions that drive key business decisions across the entire company. You’ll help us turn the vagaries of human behavior into clear, specific, and thoroughly vetted recommendations for action.

You’ll have the opportunity to wrangle that complexity into clear and direct metrics, reporting, and recommendations. You’ll work on data sets ranging from thousands to hundreds of millions of records using modern tools, and develop the skills necessary for extracting meaningful human information from them. You’ll learn how to communicate analytical insights to business stakeholders effectively, as even the most insightful analysis is useless if it isn’t understood by others.

The Role

Partner with Product, Engineering, and Real Estate Operations to analyze the health of our business, identifying and explaining sources of weakness and strength.
Apply the fundamentals of data visualization to build reports that are beautiful, clear, and compelling.
Perform targeted analyses, diving deep to answer broad questions about specific aspects of the business.
Craft and deliver presentations to stakeholders in other departments which go beyond simple reporting to provide recommendations about what the company should do in response to the facts.

Who You Are

Pursuing a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or Doctorate degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Operations Research, Business Analytics, an experimental science, or a related field.
Completed coursework or other experience using SQL to aggregate data for visualization and insights.
Completed coursework or other experience with one or more of the following in a data analytics context is a plus: Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, R, Python, Postgres, Amazon Redshift.
Having excellent communication and interpersonal skills.
Possessing a curiosity that doesn’t stop at the “What?” but hungers for the “Why?” and “What if?”

What We Offer

A fully paid internship with competitive compensation.
Close mentorship by a senior analyst who will be available for both formal and informal meetings and discussions.
The opportunity to work start to finish on a meaningful analytics project, from deciding on initial data exploration approaches to writing up specific recommendations and presenting them to stakeholders.
Intern-specific company-wide events and other support to ensure a positive learning experience.

We’re excited to get to know you and hope you’re ready to give this opportunity everything you’ve got!
