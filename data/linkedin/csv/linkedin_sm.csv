Social Media Marketing Intern,PathMatch,Los Angeles Metropolitan Area,"Are you interested in a career in Digital Marketing with a focus on Social Media Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing. This matched internship has a larger emphasis on Social Media Marketing. Students will be focused on both organic and paid social.

Most students don’t realize how critical corporate internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing or Social Media Marketing skills in a classroom. Companies look for experience working on live campaigns.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where you'll learn the fundamentals of digital marketing and get matched to an internship with our corporate partner where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.

JOB SCHEDULE: Monday through Friday, 9:00 am PST to 5:00 pm PST. See “logistics” for accommodations for other time zones. 
JOB LOCATION: Remote, virtual. 

ABOUT US:

No matter their background or identity, people of all gender identities should be able to dream big and bold. We believe that gender equality can only be achieved if everyone of all genders, identities, and backgrounds works towards this goal.

DREAM EQUAL is a global youth-led gender equality and mental health 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working to empower all people to realize their full potential regardless of gender. Through interactive programs, we strive to empower children to become capable young leaders who are confident in their goals and dreams. Through workshops and training, we seek to educate our communities about the negative effects of gender stereotypes and how to effectively combat them. We are here to advocate for a gender-sensitive education system and world. 

Rather than combating the issue after its development, DREAM EQUAL seeks to combat gender stereotypes and myths at an early age. We strive to create equal and accessible opportunities for all by reaching out to underserved communities and making our programs available to people of all ages and abilities. We believe gender equality can only be achieved by including the voices of all humans, regardless of how they choose to express themselves. DREAM EQUAL believes in grassroots, local level approaches to change. No one knows your community better than you do, and while we can help to equip you with the resources and support you need, you are best suited to use them. Let’s redefine feminine and masculine to human, together.

Description:
Here at Dream Equal we believe in learning by doing. Our goal is to empower you to lead instead of follow. We will put you in the decision-making seat multiple times during your internship; interns will take up their own projects, contribute to Dream Equal’s long-term planning, and lead their own teams. We believe that cohort programs are more beneficial than solo internships, as participants are exposed to more diverse perspectives and receive opportunities for collaboration. All interns will be placed in a cohort of about 12 interns.

Specific Projects:
Managing and creating regular content for DREAM EQUAL’s TikTok account
Following trends and brainstorming ideas
Creating plans for filming and incorporating content from DREAM EQUAL international chapters
Producing content adjusting based on constructive feedback
Assisting the Communications team with social media content creation for Instagram following DREAM EQUAL branding guidelines
Brainstorming educational content for social media platforms
Collaborating with other interns to lead an informational session or workshop on a topic related to gender equality
Additional related duties as needed

Responsibilities/Your Day-to-Day: View a sample schedule here: https://tinyurl.com/DESampleInternSchedule

Required Qualifications: None. Everyone has a voice that matters and the potential to contribute something important to the world. We believe the moment that we put a required number of years of work experience or education on an application, we remove the possibility of bringing in people onto our team that we need and value the perspectives of. Thus, when choosing our interns, rather than looking for years of experience, we look for qualities such as kindness, compassion, determination, and, most importantly, a willingness to learn. 

Logistics

Responsibilities

Interns put inquiry and theory into practice. Alongside fellow doctoral candidates and some of the world’s best researchers, interns learn, collaborate, and network for life. Interns not only advance their own careers, but they also contribute to exciting research and development strides. During the 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Research internships are available in all areas of research, and are offered year-round, though they typically begin in the summer.

The ideal candidate may be trained in any number of disciplines (including anthropology, communication, information studies, media studies, sociology, science and technology studies, or a related field), but should have a strong social scientific or humanistic methodological, analytical, and theoretical foundation, be interested in questions related to media or communication technologies and society or culture, and be interested in working in a highly interdisciplinary environment that includes computer scientists, mathematicians, and economists.

Howplatforms, through their design and policies, shape public discourse
The politics of algorithms, metrics, and big datafor a computational culture
The political economies of on-demand labor
The difference between traditional cooperatively-managed markets and Commons and online platform cooperatives
Collective, community-based approaches to content review and moderation
The gender and cultural politics of algorithmic detection of pronouns
The ethics of dataset creation and uses of large-scale social data for qualitative research

Interns are also expected to give short presentations on their project, contribute to the SMC blog, attend the weekly lab colloquia, and contribute to the life of the community through weekly lunches with fellow PhD interns and the broader lab community. There are also natural opportunities for collaboration with SMC researchers and visitors, and with others currently working at MSRNE, including computer scientists, economists, and mathematicians. PhD interns are expected to be on-site for the duration of their internship.
