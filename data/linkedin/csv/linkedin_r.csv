Research Intern - Research Assistant,Microsoft,"Redmond, WA","Virtual Internship

Participation in the Research Internship Program requires that you are physically located in the United States or Canada for the duration of the internship

Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

Many physicists have wondered how the universe chooses its basic laws. One idea is that the laws-or the parameters that characterize them, such as the masses of the different quarks and leptons, can evolve in time. Several mechanisms have been proposed, which can be visualized as a point representing the universe moving on a vast landscape of possible laws. This turns out to be a process that can be efficiently simulated by a deep neural network. We continue our work started in 2020 building and running models to investigate this and other ideas about how the universe chose or learnt its laws. Project co-led by Microsoft researcher Jaron Lanier, Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and Stephon Alexander of Brown University.

G-4 Visas For Interns

All interns assigned to a UN Organization, including Funds and Programmes, at a United States based duty station, who are not United States citizens or United States legal permanent residents (LPR) will be required to obtain G-4 visas prior to travelling to the United States.

Prospective interns who are already in the United States in another nonimmigrant status may need to apply for a change of status to G-4 prior to joining the United Nations for an internship. It should be emphasized that prospective interns are responsible for ensuring that they have an appropriate valid visa and employment authorization allowing them to undertake the internship.

If the applicant is in F-1 status and has a valid EAD, they may undertake an internship within the scope of their F-1 visa without seeking a change of visa status. Please note, however, that interns in F-1 status who wish to undertake an internship following completion of their academic programme as part of Optional Practical Training (OPT) ‘may’ need to seek a change of visa status to G-4 (This process currently takes about 8-10 weeks) or obtain G-4 visa overseas.

To qualify for G-4 nonimmigrant status, interns must be serving essentially full-time, i.e. 35 + hours per week.

Remote Internship (covid-19)

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, applicants may be requested to undertake the internship remotely in view of constraints regarding visa issuance, international travel and access to UN premises. Applicants must be willing and prepared to undertake the internship remotely for a part or the entirety of the internship.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c).

Job CategoryInternJob Details
Tableau is on a mission to help people see and understand data, which requires significant innovation. Tableau Research is a small team that uses academic methodologies to foster innovation throughout the company. We have a diverse team of research scientists whose expertise spans data systems, data science and data visualization, plus experts in related areas such as interaction, cartography and natural language processing. Our research often involves innovative based on combining these areas, like the Tableau product itself.

For the upcoming year, our research priorities are:
DATA MODELING AND MANAGEMENT. Cleaning, curating and shaping data is even harder (and more technical) than visualizing it. How can we help people get the right data quickly and easily?
MOBILE ANALYTICS. Our goal is Tableau everywhere, but there s a lot to learn about how people want to use data away from their desks. Includes both mobile and AR.
INSIGHT VALIDATION. The goal of analytics is insight into data how can we help people be sure the insights they see are real? How can we alert them to potential problems without overwhelming them?
AUTOMATION. Robust, reliable automatic methods can provide a power-boost to people performing the complex task of analytics. But people should be able to question and explore the results. What is the right balance for our users? While these are our priorities, they are not exclusive. A research internship is based on a mutually formulated project that furthers both a graduate student s research career and supports a research topic that is being explored by a member of Tableau Research. Candidates should explore our website (research.tableau.com) to find potential intern hosts. A research internship is a great way for students to learn more about industrial research, which has both academic publishing goals and the opportunity to impact our products. While many projects result in publications, others may produce only novel prototypes for exploration and inspiration. Research internships are typically three months long and most commonly occur in the summer, but we are flexible.

What You Ll Be Doing
Work closely with a member of Tableau research, including regular meetings and feedback. * Present your project proposal and final results at the weekly Tableau Research Workshop.
Create and document a body of work (code, studies, and writings), which may lead to a published paper.

Who You Are
EDUCATED. You are a PhD student in computer science or a related field.
SUPPORT OUR MISSION. You care about helping people see and understand data.
SKILLED. Research interns need sufficient experience and technical skills to work collaboratively with their hosts.

Research and Dissemination Summer Intern 2021,The Primary School,"San Francisco, CA","About The Organization

The Primary School is expanding the boundaries of traditional education. Our holistic model weaves together education, health, and family support services to ensure underserved children have the system of care they need to lead meaningful and emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy lives. The Primary School was founded in 2015, supported by seed funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a major national philanthropy.

Our approach has three defining characteristics:
We start early. We start working with parents and enroll children into our program as early as 12 months to reach them at their most critical stage in development.
We work with - not around - families. We know that parents and caregivers are the most important people in a child's life. We partner with them to enhance the education and health of their children.
We integrate multiple systems to serve the whole child. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.

In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four-year-olds. We have grown to serve over 300 children and their families via a 0-3 parent/child program, a preschool and elementary school, and a parent wellness program.

Our ultimate goal is to create a game-changing system of care for children that can be replicated across the country. To that end, we are building a model that can be effectively implemented in diverse communities and sustained on public funding. In 2020 we expanded our student and family population in East Palo Alto and opened our next site in Hayward, California. In 2021, we will be piloting our Bridge to Preschool program in San Francisco for the first time. It's an exciting time to join the team!

About The Role

The Primary School internship program is a paid summer internship for current undergraduate/ graduate students interested in exploring nonprofit management careers at the intersection of education, health and family support. During the 10-12 week program, interns engage in hands-on, project-based learning, and also participate in high-impact developmental and networking programming. This includes opportunities to build meaningful relationships with other interns, TPS staff, and the broader TPS family and East Palo Alto/San Francisco community.

The Partnerships and Dissemination Intern will work closely with our Research, Design, Dissemination and Policy team, as well as our Birth to Three team and our San Francisco partners. As the Partnerships and Dissemination Intern , you will focus on our early childhood work in San Francisco, and help our team execute on pilot programs, and capture learning and codify practices as we look to influence sites, agencies, and systems with our model. You will also participate in learning and design sessions with our SF team and partner agencies around early intervention, social-emotional learning, early childhood mental health, and family engagement. You will gain experience in program codification and project management. You will also work with our data team to collect, analyze, present, and facilitate usage of data. This is a great opportunity for a student seeking to learn more about program execution and policy work in early education, and what it looks like to partner with different stakeholders to accomplish our goals.

RESPONSIBILITIES:
Support with documenting learning from partnership projects, including Bridge to Preschool in San Francisco
Participate in partnership meetings with various stakeholders in San Francisco's ECE ecosystem
Interview stakeholders and present findings from partner programs
Collaborate with our program teams to codify our partnership and dissemination process

Position Description The rich history of African American people, cultures, and communities in Essex County,Massachusetts runs deep. This history is embedded in the cultural landscape, fromcemeteries to a renamed park in honor of two famed 19th century black abolitionists. EssexCounty residents, archivists, educators, interpreters, historians, and scholars alike have beenworking to unearth this history and recover these fascinating stories in order to provide afuller account of the county's past and present. In a span of nearly four hundred years, Blackpeople have shaped and been shaped by Essex County. However, real challenges, historicand contemporary, have thwarted the efforts of even the most enterprising and well-trainedexperts because much of this history is hidden, scattered or misplaced. And therein lies theopportunity and need that must be met. Because this history is hidden, residents andtourists alike fail to appreciate the fundamental role African Americans have played in thehistory of Essex County. In 2020, the two-year, grant-funded report, The African AmericanExperience in Essex County, Massachusetts: An Annotated Guide, was completed. Thepurpose of the report is to identify, locate, and compile the collections and resources,organizations, and individuals concerning the Black experience in Essex County. Our twoNational Park Service units in Essex County have sought to implement an inclusive,audience-centered interpretative approach that more prominently features the stories ofAfrican Americans. The report synthesizes key themes and offers suggestions for projectsand serves as a basis for developing historically sound, inclusive programming, fromexhibitions to school projects. African Americans and people of African descent stand tall inEssex County's past, present, and future. There are a wide range of stories and accounts ofBlack women in these collections and repositories. However, there is no singular ""Blackwoman's” story to be told. The intern would work within a theme of the diverse ways inwhich Black women built lives, careers, and families, as well as fought for change, survivedand resisted oppression, and spoke out boldly for themselves and others. The intern willresearch African American women of Essex County who operated within and outside ofsystems that were intended to reduce or limit them; Black women who were leaders ineducation, in business, in civic life, in family life, in activism. The research will focus on boththe names that are well-known and the countless women whose names history hasforgotten, but who nevertheless built and fueled the culture of Essex County for generations.In the ""Recommendations” section of the report, these are a few of the women suggested tobe researched: Charlotte Forten (Salem State University), Rose Lovejoy (Andover), FrancesCole Lee (Haverhill Public Library), Myrna Mitchell Brown (Lawrence), Sarah Remond (PhillipsLibrary), Juno Larcom (Historic Beverly), Agnes (Marblehead), and Sara Baro Colcher(Topsfield). While there are few complete collections of Black women's archival materials,African American women are not completely absent in the historical records. An exhibitcould make this explicit. Suggested ways an intern could tell the stories of the hundreds ofBlack women who have lived in Essex County who did not leave behind personal materials inthe archives include:
Using names from Massachusetts Vital Records and selecting somefrom Essex County to trace through Marriage, Births, and Deaths;
telling the story of Blackwomen who had accounts at the Salem Savings Bank using the records available throughthe Salem State University Archives; and
giving voice to the stories of Black women who were incarcerated at Essex County Jail. The intern will be responsible for researching,planning, drafting, and proposing an exhibit for the Salem Armory Visitor Center that couldalso travel to historic sites and museums in Essex County. Qualifications The intern should ideally be working toward a graduate degree in history or a related field, and have course work, experience, or interest in African American history, public history, education, and/or interpretation. The intern must have strong oral and written communication skills and some experience in working in the archives and/or at museum/historic site settings. The intern should be able to work independently 75% of the time. The intern should be someone who has experience and/or interest in developing an inclusive, audience-centered approach to education and interpretation that more prominently features and centers the stories of African American women.

NLP Research Intern,Abridge,"Remote, OR","When you think about your last doctor’s appointment, how much do you actually recall? If you’re like most people, you’ll likely forget over 40% of the conversation. Details fall through the cracks, generic printouts you receive end up in the trash, and important information never makes it to other doctors. Ultimately, you’re left needing to connect the dots in your care. That’s why we started Abridge with a simple thesis: if we can shift agency to consumers, we can help them stay on top of their health. When you use Abridge to record your health conversations, the conversations themselves become your medical record. It’s as easy as that.

We are looking for research interns to working on exciting NLP challenges using our large annotated proprietary healthcare datasets. You will be able to create/customize your internship research statement and collaborate with our in-house Machine Learning research team. At the end of the internship, you will also have the opportunity to publish your work at top tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, NAACL, and ACL.

The goal of the internship is to advance the state-of-the-art in one or many of the following research areas:

Dialog Understanding
Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling
Clinical Natural Language Processing
Information Extraction
Machine Learning using Ontologies or Knowledge graphs

Required Qualification

Must be accepted to or currently enrolled in an MS or Ph.D. program in Computer Science or a related field
Must have at least one NLP machine learning paper submitted or published
Experience in utilizing theoretical and empirical research to solve problems
Ability to communicate complex research ideas in a clear, precise, and actionable manner
Research internships are offered year-round with flexible durations

Compensation
$80,000-$100,000 per year
Life at Abridge

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and believe that ""you need to taste good things to have good taste.""

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2427331316?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Elever%2Eco%2Fabridge%2Fab2711f3-9e25-43b2-8047-ee9ef00ac0b0%2Fapply%3Flever-source%3DLinkedIn&urlHash=QdKJ&refId=a51410ad-b71a-4c02-8efb-8a6a917b2a91&trackingId=ldvh2wV%2Byq%2Fb46c7Ar2Eew%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite

Futurewei Technologies based in Santa Clara, CA is actively pursuing innovative ideas and different new and disruptive technologies. We are seeking an intern with experience in training and testing autonomous driving models. For the purposes of training and testing autonomous driving (AD) models, we need the following three techniques to generate the simulated data.

[1] By a probabilistic langu age, the simulated traffic data are generated based on the formal descriptions of scenes and driving behaviors. For example, the pedestrians crossing the roads, the cars changing the lanes disobeying the rules, etc. A collection of behavior labels are well defined for users to describe the traffic scene with ease.

[2] The simulated data are efficiently genera ted based on the real observations from the massive traffic surveillance video, by means of the abstracted behavior characteristics. The statistical distribution of traffic accidents is therefore achieved such that the simulated data are close to the real world.

[3] The evaluation system gives comprehensive scores of any AD model in various scenarios, with t he corresponding confidence degrees, as well as the causal analysis of the fatal weakness. For instance, the crash was due to a wrong perception, or misunderstanding of the intention of other drivers, etc.

Challenged, but not overwhelmed: We are curious people who always want to grow. Growth happens outside our comfort zone. We achieve our potential through consistent, manageable growth

Use data, both within Redfin and from other sources, to find new insights and compelling research that help the public, press, policymakers, and Redfin leadership understand the housing market. Much of the output of this role will be public-facing and published in news publications such as the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.
Work with Redfin’s data scientists and engineers to help evaluate natural experiments to help better understand how sensitive housing choice is to information on schools, transportation, taxes, or climate risk. 
Evaluate some of the latest developments in housing and economic policy through the lens of our housing data to help Redfin and the public understand them as appropriate.
Work with APIs and many public datasets (e.g., IPUMS or ACS) and design compelling data visualizations or interactive tools in combination with our data.

Skills & Experience 

Master’s degree student or a Ph.D. student in economics, statistics, urban planning, or a related field
Great communication skills and ability to explain complex ideas clearly to a non-technical audience
Expertise with at least one statistical software package such as R, Python, Stata, etc.
