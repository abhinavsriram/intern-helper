It's also getting increasingly competitive, as more and better programs are launched each semester. Universities need to go online quickly, economically, and elegantly, creating programs that students can't wait to tell their friends about and that their professors want to teach.

Planned topics include personal branding, design thinking, personal finance, job search strategy, and more.

About You
