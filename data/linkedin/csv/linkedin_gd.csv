Graphic Design for Social Change Internship -- Winter 2021 (Full-time),A/B Partners,"New York, NY","A/B is a digital storytelling studio creating new narratives about people, power, and social change to transform our politics and the economy. Our studio is built for where media is today and where it's going tomorrow, staffed by strategists, creatives, and analysts ready to take our partners through every step in their journey from idea to influence.

Our team is racially and gender diverse at every level, from entry level to ownership; we are bringing the best-in-class creative strategies usually reserved for the private sector side by side with deep experience in social movements and ventures; and we are building a team that can help a new generation of leaders win the debate on their terms. We are here to find new ways into the headlines and to move people toward the values that will accelerate transformative shifts in policy and human understanding.

We do this by understanding the two sides of every story: A and B. The A story is the story we can see, the news cycle we can influence. The B story is mostly invisible, but powerful. It's driven by the unwritten rules and power dynamics that shape people's beliefs, behaviors and values. Social and political change requires us to tackle both stories, to win the conversation but also to focus it on promoting new values and attacking the silent assumption that who we are should dictate our ability to live up to our full potential.

Social Media Marketing Intern,PathMatch,Los Angeles Metropolitan Area,"Are you interested in a career in Digital Marketing with a focus on Social Media Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing. This matched internship has a larger emphasis on Social Media Marketing. Students will be focused on both organic and paid social.

Most students don’t realize how critical corporate internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing or Social Media Marketing skills in a classroom. Companies look for experience working on live campaigns.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where you'll learn the fundamentals of digital marketing and get matched to an internship with our corporate partner where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.

Ironic Music Booking Agency is the most innovative booking agency on the New England music scene. We handle a wide array of artists and are confident that we can provide the perfect entertainment for any venue or situation. We pride ourselves in differentiating from the ‘average’ booking agent in that we focus a great deal of attention on the social media marketing of all the gigs we book.

Ironic Music Booking Agency began over 10 years ago. Early on, we realized that there were many small to medium sized venues who were interested in live entertainment but they either didn't have sufficient space/need for a larger formation, or lacked sufficient budget, or both. Ironic naturally migrated to this niche market and has since, almost by default, specialized in acoustic music, boasting the largest roster of acoustic acts in New England.

Job Description

The Marketing Intern will primarily be responsible for researching and targeting potential new markets for Ironic, from marketing to lead generation to marketing materials. His/her foremost priorities are as follows:

Update/improve a detailed database of artists which Client represents, including all of their updated info. Gather necessary promo information on artists to be used in marketing, promotion and/or other.
Research new markets where Client could potentially propose her musicians/bands to perform (mainly in New England).
Intern will also be responsible in assisting the Client in discovering, soliciting and signing musicians to be booked as well as participate in and learn about contract negotiation with the bands to be signed. Client is by no means obligated to consider, accept and sign the bands/musicians which Music Booking Intern presents.
Post a brief description of gigs as booked by Client on-line, to a number of websites. List to be provided by Client. Intern may also be asked to assist in researching additional sites to promote Client’s gigs and/or services.
Fill-in online forms in order to generate buzz and get the Clients’ musicians’ gigs promoted in the most efficient, effective and timely manner possible.
The Client is in no means restricted to requesting only the aforementioned duties of the Intern insomuch as they are related to the overall goals of the Client in booking music talent to various venues, festivals, coffee houses, community events, private parties, etc.

Volunteer: Graphic Design/Videography Intern,Greenstand,"Anchorage, AK","Greenstand develops mobile technology for better forestation techniques. Through our Treetracker app, rural smallholder farmers in some of the most remote communities on the planet are able to earn a sustainable income by planting, caring for, and tracking trees. Each tree grower takes a geotagged photo of their tree and uploads it to the Treetracker’s verification system, where Greenstanders verify that each photographed tree is alive and growing. Verified trees are digitized as Impact Tokens, which can be traded or sold among other Impact Wallet users within the Treetracker app.

Nasiyan was our first Treetracker. A single mother living with extreme visual and hearing impairments, she could barely afford to keep food on the table for herself and her three sons. However, since she began growing and tracking trees with Greenstand, her life has been looking up. Her young forest has become a small biodiversity hotspot, and with the income she has earned from tracking trees, she can now afford to send her boys to school.

Are you interested in helping us fight climate change and extreme poverty? We’re interested in you! Please check out our open opportunities or shoot us an email at info@greenstand.org. We can’t wait to hear from you!
Greenstand is a fully remote social non-profit organization turning environmental stewardship into a reliable source of income. Our work tackles both extreme poverty and climate change. Our main product is Treetracker, a mobile app that allows planting organizations and their donors to track the growth of newly planted trees through periodic geotagged photos. Find out more about our project at Greenstand.org.

Marketing Intern,Class Four,"Burlington, VT","We’re searching for a talented marketing intern to join our team for the summer. The ideal candidate is looking to gain campaign-management experience and will be assisting our team building and deploying material for full service clients. Weekly tasks will include taking part in strategy meetings, developing and formatting content, assisting with sends, and querying data for reporting. At Class Four, you’ll have an opportunity to engage with three core sides of the full service pipeline – strategy, production, and deployment. You’ll learn and apply industry best practice for setting up email marketing campaigns, automated flows and advanced segmentation. 

If you’re interested in exploring the content side of our business, there’s lots of opportunity to get out of the office with our media production team too. We develop world class content locally and across the country for international brands. Often, marketers only interact with media at the deployment level, so if you’ve ever wondered what goes into producing video and photo branded content, this is a great opportunity to engage with it up close. 

We have structured this position to provide maximum exposure to as much of the marketing and creative process as possible. Although your role is primarily focused on the campaign, you’ll have an opportunity to dive in on different parts of projects, and tailor the experience to your specific interests once you’re here. We’ll treat you like the other stakeholders at the company (within reason)– so if taking on some responsibility and gaining real workplace experience on a small team sounds exciting, Class Four is probably a great fit for you! 


Your day-to-day at Class Four:

Engage in our internal team meetings, take direction and provide feedback
Setup and deploy email and social campaigns under supervision from project manager
Work with our content team to coordinate media needs
Attend content shoots, observe and engage with production process 
Come up with bad-ass ideas and be a part of execution

About us:

Class Four is a small full service agency that develops world class content and strategy in Burlington VT. The business was started as a senior project by two 2017 Champlain grads and since has grown to support some of the largest international brands through content, along with a number local Burlington businesses at a full service level. Our workplace culture is fun, exciting (no two days are ever the same) and stimulating – but if you’re someone who is looking for an ultra high structure environment or specific focus, this might not be the best fit. Our ideal candidate:

Will take ownership in the work. If you have a cool idea or want to try something out, we want to hear it, and help you execute. 
Is curious and willing to learn
Will offer feedback and suggestions
Is independent – knows how to take initiative and creatively problem solve
Is deadline oriented – this position is fun and exciting, but work still needs to get done and our team could be relying on you!
Knows how to ask for help when they need it
Is able to take direction
Is looking for a “startup” style experience

There is additional potential for this role to continue post-summer as a paid, part-time student position, and transition to full time post grad. If you’d like to know more about this position, compensation (yes this is paid), and time commitment, please send an intro to launchcontrol@classfour.co. We’re looking for a short paragraph on why this position excites you, what your long term goals are, and a list of previous (relevant) experience. If you don’t have experience, we’d still love to hear from you — attitude and drive go a long way, and we’ll give you all the instruction you need to be successful here for the summer!",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2270186905?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsiguecorp%2Ecatsone%2Ecom%2Fcareers%2F23257-General%2Fjobs%2F13758620-Digital-Marketing-Intern&urlHash=GaaZ&refId=92dc7cbb-3141-4676-a68b-a76af744a81d&trackingId=cm7HzwR%2F%2BBo3qkmO4NZy%2BA%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

Applicants are urged to follow carefully all instructions available in the online recruitment platform, inspira. For more detailed guidance, applicants may refer to the Manual for the Applicant, which can be accessed by clicking on “Manuals” hyper-link on the upper right side of the inspira account-holder homepage.

The evaluation of applicants will be conducted on the basis of the information submitted in the application according to the evaluation criteria of the job opening and the applicable internal legislations of the United Nations including the Charter of the United Nations, resolutions of the General Assembly, the Staff Regulations and Rules, administrative issuances and guidelines.

No amendment, addition, deletion, revision or modification shall be made to applications that have been submitted.
