Role Overview

Punchline: We're looking for all-star operations interns to help our Program Directors launch and run our new Fellowship programs .

You may have seen, we're launching a lot of new Fellowship programs ! :) Each one becomes a critical piece of the interweaving flywheel of products we're building at On Deck.

When considering launching new programs, we ask ourselves: does this make the broader On Deck ecosystem stronger, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts?

For every program we've launched thus far, we see the potential for it to become a multi-million dollar business line.

We're looking for operations interns to help our Operations Generalists and Program Directors bring their programs from 0 to 1.

Responsibilities

Programs don't happen without the Operations team executing on every last detail — that's where you come in.

On this team, you'll work on the program structure, events & opportunities we offer to Fellows.

We’re looking for a force of nature; someone who will do whatever it takes — both strategically & tactically — to make a massive positive impact on our fellows' lives.

This is an incredibly exciting role, with lots of opportunities to learn, get your hands dirty, take on lots of responsibility from Day One, and bring something from a mere concept into a full-fledged profitable business unit.

Ultimately, ensuring fellows have a mind-blowing experience unlike any other community they've ever been part of.
The Labs team will be here for you. Any question, any ask, any meeting, anything you need — we will block time to make it happen.

Why Might Excite You About Us
We’re tackling a big problem with even bigger potential. Participants in our existing Fellowships say great things about us .
You’ll be able to work remotely and (mostly) set your own schedule. On Deck was a remote-first team even before COVID, so we know what makes for a great remote environment.
You'll have a lot of flexibility in your role, and will be able to help define what our operations infrastructure looks like going forward.
We're backed by a who’s who of the biggest names in the venture investing world, including Village Global, Keith Rabois, Balaji Srinivasan, Bloomberg Beta, and so many more. (Read more about our fundraise and 50-year vision here .)

Why you might *not* be excited about us:
We are still a fairly young company with about 100 people, so if you like more established companies, this role isn’t for you. You'll help create our company's culture.
We're an early stage startup. Projects and priorities are likely to shift.
Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to push towards our lofty ambitions. Most people won’t be cut out for it.
You should be comfortable with just a dash of chaos. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day.
On Deck is an unabashedly pro-startup, pro-tech organization. If that’s not your thing, this isn’t the place for you.

Location, start date and compensation:

This is a paid, full-time internship for 3 months. Start date is flexible, but we prioritize folks who are ready to start ASAP.

Our team works remotely, but you will have to be available to work on U.S.-friendly hours, which may be difficult from Europe or Asia.

Our program includes some weekend and evening events, which you would be expected to attend.

You would start as soon as possible.

Important

Please note, the application questions are the most important part of this application. We will be reviewing them closely to determine who will move on in our hiring process. Please answer thoughtfully and take your time.

Summary

In summary, On Deck may not be the place for you if

If you were to join On Deck, we'd want you to love it. We also know that it can be hard to tell from the outside looking in whether that would be the case for you. So, we challenged ourselves to develop an honest set of reasons someone wouldn't want to join our company . We hope it helps you make an informed decision about whether On Deck is a place you'd love to work.

Another company's mission gets you way more fired up.
You want a 9-5 job.
You do your best work in highly-structured, steady-paced, and meticulously-planned environments.
You like finding and poking holes more than you like filling them.
You see differences as divisions.

About Great Jones

Great Jones brings ease and performance to rental ownership and living, starting by reinventing property management for the several trillion (!) dollars in rental homes owned by small-scale investors.

We're replacing an experience that has historically been heavily operational, low-tech, and stressful with one delivered through modern software, thoughtful experience design, real benefits of scale, and the right blend of local & centralized operations.

By providing a seamless, full-service experience for owners and residents, we aim to make ownership worry-free and more profitable for the 25 million Americans who own rental homes. In doing so, we become the operating system around our owners' most valuable investments, as well as our residents' homes.

And we're doing this within an enormous addressable market, with highly attractive unit economics, where competition is deeply fragmented and notorious for subpar service.

We are growing rapidly with nationwide expansion on deck -- headquartered in Manhattan with on-the-ground operations in 20 markets across 9 states.

Our leadership team has built digital platforms and operational machines that have powered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of transactions for marketplace businesses like 1stdibs, Skillshare, and Warby Parker.

We've raised over $30 million (including our recently closed Series B) from top investors including Crosslink Capital, Navitas Capital, Zigg Capital, Juxtapose, and top NYC angels & real estate entrepreneurs including Kevin Ryan, David Rosenblatt, and Jason Finger, who have founded or led companies such as Seamless, Gilt Groupe, MongoDB, DoubleClick, 1stdibs, Floored, and others.","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2495150666?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgrnh%2Ese%2F426ea1f63us&urlHash=RCa7&refId=6898bcf7-2597-473f-8021-f61bb9a1bd90&trackingId=bobzIDeM33DVzqkhATyaCA%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite",0.0010713302625301334,

Tile’s Mission

We solve real problems with technology to make people’s daily lives better.

At Tile, we recognize that daily life is challenging. We lead busy lives filled with family, friends, jobs, pets, and other things we love. Balancing this can be demanding, unpredictable and stressful.

We use technology to solve real everyday problems that keep each day running smoothly. People rely on Tile to be a seamless part of their lives whether they are at home or out in the world.

By helping to make daily lives easier, we free people to find their best lives — whatever that means to them. Tile is for everyone, on every platform, everywhere in the world. Tile for life.

About Tile

Tile is best known today for its market-leading Bluetooth finders with over 35 million units sold and ~5M items located daily. That said, Tile has recently expanded the devices that are findable by its platform by embedding its software into third-party products.

Over 30 billion Bluetooth devices are shipping over the next 5 years and each of these can be Tile-enabled with a software update. Partnerships have been announced with HP for laptops, leading audio headset OEMs like Bose and SkullCandy, and several others. Tile also has a large portfolio of unannounced OEM partnerships with top brands in many other large verticals (e.g. wearables, bikes, etc.) and is integrating its technology on the Bluetooth chips to make the Tile enablement more seamless for these partners (e.g. Tile has a partnership with Intel for PCs).

In addition to the OEM and chip partnerships, Tile is scaling its finding network by entering into access point partnerships with companies like Google, Amazon, and Comcast (all announced and ongoing).

From a business model perspective, Tile is shifting the relationship with its customers from a transactional device sale to offering a long-term, high-value service. Tile introduced its premium service two years ago and has ~400K subscribers today with a specific focus on growing annual recurring revenue.

We are guided by our company values, which are Start with Trust, Bring It, Build What Matters, Better Together, and Power What’s Next. Recently accredited as a Great Place to Work, we are a high-performing team and our leaders consider themselves to be performance coaches with a primary responsibility of accelerating Tile’s success and that of their teammates. We know that the more our consumers win, the more we win, and we love working with like-minded teammates to do just that.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2425526496?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Elever%2Eco%2Ftileapp%2F2f10b7bc-54d7-4a35-abce-e5cbe8929e9a%3Flever-source%3DLinkedInJobs&urlHash=lS3U&refId=09adc478-402d-4a29-9f8a-c6b4d247def5&trackingId=17CinXD0S2dfg9d%2FxzXWWQ%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite",0.001178116186117312,
