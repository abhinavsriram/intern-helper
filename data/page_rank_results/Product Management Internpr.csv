Join the team that is helping the world’s most sophisticated organizations transform their industries by harnessing the power of data. Our internship program is based in our New York City office.

As an intern you will work directly with MongoDB’s product managers, user experience designers and engineers. You will be fully integrated into the team helping to analyze user’s pains and advocate on their behalf, mine various data sources to discover new product requirements, develop and communicate product strategy to relevant stakeholders, maintain roadmaps and prioritize product/sprint backlogs, and deliver & launch new capabilities to drive our product strategy.

Our summer program is comprehensive and interactive - you won’t sit behind a desk all day. We have social outings (think team dinners, broadway shows, NYC sightseeing, and more) and an intern speaker series where you’ll hear from some of the most significant and important people in tech today. You’ll gain insight into what makes a billion dollar company run. At the end of the summer you’ll be a better program manager and a more informed citizen of the world.

What We Are Looking For In You...
You are in the process of receiving a Bachelor’s or Master's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Systems, Data Science, or related fields. Alternatively you have a background in STEM and are now pursuing your MBA
You have solid technical skills — our users are software engineers, DBA's, sysadmins, etc. Our product managers must be just as technical and have working knowledge in these areas to better advocate for our users; while not expected to write production code, you should be comfortable diving into new code, learning from existing examples, exploring APIs, triaging bugs, analyzing support cases, and speaking on any of the technical aspects of the tools in your portfolio
You are an excellent communicator, both through verbal and written means
You are curious and have a strong desire to learn and adapt; you are a self starter and thrive in ambiguity


What You'll Find At MongoDB…
You will get a crash course in product management at a marquee tech company
You will get first hand experience in how a $10B company makes short term and long term strategic decisions (despite our size, we have a very small, highly leveraged product team!)
You will get hands on experience in building “deep tech” products, such as distributed databases
You will get a mix of ‘product experience’, from building a business case for a new product line to tactical product management with engineering teams, to overseeing the commercialization of new products
You will have a front row seat to see a major secular shift in the database industry
You will understand the hard work necessary to consistently innovate and build a lasting business

The Role:

There will be two Product Management Interns. One will work to identify data streams that can help customers predict demand which can be incorporated in Demand Suite of products. This intern will also create sanitized customer time series information that can be used for future research and QA purposes.

The second intern in this role will work to improve the current template apps through user research and customer extension. They will deliver new apps in areas where customers have created apps to solve their own problems which could be more broadly applicable.

 

Project Opportunities: Examples

Project 1: As an intern on this project, you will spend the first two weeks learning demand guru (self-paced) and collect customer data and product characteristics from current customers. During the second four weeks, you procure sample data from different data streams (from customers for data like IDC and from vendors for other data) and do analysis to pick data that should be procured to be made part of the product by specific industries. There will be a presentation at the end of the project to the audience on what showed high correlation and what did we learn from those that can be applied for the future.

Project 2: As an intern on this project, you will spend the first two weeks learning app builder and current set of apps. During the next two weeks you will take an app that has been prioritized and work with UX and users to do user experience research and improve the template app. During the last two weeks you will create a new template app from scratch based on a customer business problem that has been prioritized as broadly useful and impactful. At the end of the project, you will present what you have learned and demonstrate the new template app and the improved template app.

 

The Qualifications:

Pursuing an undergraduate degree, preferably with a data analytics, business, or UX background
Be self-motivated and detail oriented.
Ability to work in a fast-paced dynamic work environment.
Strong analytical abilities to convert business requirements into actionable work

Why should you join us?

Look, there's lots of reasons to join any high-growth startup. Get on a rocket ship blah blah blah. If you're the kind of candidate we're looking for, then you already know this. Here are a few other reasons you might not already know:

We're a team of under 20 people, despite being at the Series A stage. You will be one of the first 20 employees and will profoundly impact where the company goes in the coming years.

Everyone thinks about becoming a parent. You will help couples on their journey to creating a family. You will help push society towards a fairer, more equitable place. You will be a trusted resource for men and women at the most intimate moment in their lives, including heterosexual couples, LGBTQ+ couples, and individuals who are thinking about how and when they'll want to have a family in the future.

We will invest in you like you wouldn't believe. Every single hire gets an executive coach. You'll get training for anything you need. We'll give you an unlimited 'Health & Wellness' stipend where we pay for 75% of anything you deem might improve your life (Mattresses, Pelotons, etc.) You'll have a 'buddy'. We'll set you up with a charity and match your contributions. And we will talk about your careers goals, aspirations, and feelings every single week.

(Oh - and of course you'll get the same health care, 401K, unlimited time off, and other perks that any serious company offers its team members today.)

Ultimately, we are here to win, and we believe that the best way to win is to help everyone bring their absolute best self to work. So our job is to help you be the best personal and professional version of yourself that you want to be.
