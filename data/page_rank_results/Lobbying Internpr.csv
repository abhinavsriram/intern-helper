United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

15,"Intern/ Rights & Liberties Program","Sunwater Institute","Rockville, MD","THE SUNWATER INSTITUTE
The Sunwater Institute is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy organization established to create, discuss, and implement fundamental ideas that advance liberty, knowledge, and power for individuals and society. The Sunwater Institute’s interdisciplinary, long-term orientation and focus on the building blocks of social systems sets it apart as haven for bold, fresh ideas and free, constructive dialogue.
 POSITION
The Institute is seeking Interns to contribute to its new program on rights and liberties. Obviously this moment is a period in which there is a great deal of debate about human rights, constitutional rights, and related ideas about rights and liberties, so this is a most exciting time to be engaged in such research. This internship offers a chance to learn more about rights and liberties, to engage in original research, and to potentially publish that research.
 This internship is an unpaid position. Applicants must be willing to work a minimum of 20 hours per week, with at least half of those hours during standard business hours on-site at the Sunwater Institute in N. Bethesda. MD. The Sunwater Institute is on the Red Line, about a 10 minute walk, or a short bus ride, from Twinbrook Metro. Students will typically be hired on the standard academic semester calendar, so some flexibility in hours will be allowed around exams and other periods of high academic demand on the intern’s time.
 RESPONSIBILITIES
 Interns will engage in research concerning rights and liberties. For any given right that is studied, we seek to understand a number of more granular questions, such as:
Differing approaches to the right in different cultures or political regimes
The ideas or events that led to the right being considered a right
Conceptions of the role of the right in the wider state and society
Conceptions of potential limitations of the right
Policy recommendations concerning the right
 Under guidance of full-time staff at the Institute, interns will engage in research that will allow for better understanding of rights and liberties, along the lines indicated above.

REQUIREMENTS
Current enrollment in a college program, recent college graduate, or admission to a graduate program
Strong academic foundation in economics, politics, philosophy, history, or a related field
Expected to work remotely and transition to working onsite after a month

How to Apply – submit an application package including:
Cover letter: Your cover letter should explain your interest in rights and liberties, and your academic experiences that would inform your research at Sunwater
Resume or CV
Writing sample: Please submit a paper you have written for an academic course. It need not be about rights and liberties, but it should be work which shows your writing skills
