50,"Graphic Design for Social Change Internship -- Winter 2021 (Full-time)","A/B Partners","New York, NY","A/B is a digital storytelling studio creating new narratives about people, power, and social change to transform our politics and the economy. Our studio is built for where media is today and where it's going tomorrow, staffed by strategists, creatives, and analysts ready to take our partners through every step in their journey from idea to influence.

Our team is racially and gender diverse at every level, from entry level to ownership; we are bringing the best-in-class creative strategies usually reserved for the private sector side by side with deep experience in social movements and ventures; and we are building a team that can help a new generation of leaders win the debate on their terms. We are here to find new ways into the headlines and to move people toward the values that will accelerate transformative shifts in policy and human understanding.

We do this by understanding the two sides of every story: A and B. The A story is the story we can see, the news cycle we can influence. The B story is mostly invisible, but powerful. It's driven by the unwritten rules and power dynamics that shape people's beliefs, behaviors and values. Social and political change requires us to tackle both stories, to win the conversation but also to focus it on promoting new values and attacking the silent assumption that who we are should dictate our ability to live up to our full potential.

235,"Marketing Intern","Class Four","Burlington, VT","We’re searching for a talented marketing intern to join our team for the summer. The ideal candidate is looking to gain campaign-management experience and will be assisting our team building and deploying material for full service clients. Weekly tasks will include taking part in strategy meetings, developing and formatting content, assisting with sends, and querying data for reporting. At Class Four, you’ll have an opportunity to engage with three core sides of the full service pipeline – strategy, production, and deployment. You’ll learn and apply industry best practice for setting up email marketing campaigns, automated flows and advanced segmentation. 

If you’re interested in exploring the content side of our business, there’s lots of opportunity to get out of the office with our media production team too. We develop world class content locally and across the country for international brands. Often, marketers only interact with media at the deployment level, so if you’ve ever wondered what goes into producing video and photo branded content, this is a great opportunity to engage with it up close. 

We have structured this position to provide maximum exposure to as much of the marketing and creative process as possible. Although your role is primarily focused on the campaign, you’ll have an opportunity to dive in on different parts of projects, and tailor the experience to your specific interests once you’re here. We’ll treat you like the other stakeholders at the company (within reason)– so if taking on some responsibility and gaining real workplace experience on a small team sounds exciting, Class Four is probably a great fit for you! 


Your day-to-day at Class Four:

Engage in our internal team meetings, take direction and provide feedback
Setup and deploy email and social campaigns under supervision from project manager
Work with our content team to coordinate media needs
Attend content shoots, observe and engage with production process 
Come up with bad-ass ideas and be a part of execution

About us:

Class Four is a small full service agency that develops world class content and strategy in Burlington VT. The business was started as a senior project by two 2017 Champlain grads and since has grown to support some of the largest international brands through content, along with a number local Burlington businesses at a full service level. Our workplace culture is fun, exciting (no two days are ever the same) and stimulating – but if you’re someone who is looking for an ultra high structure environment or specific focus, this might not be the best fit. Our ideal candidate:

Will take ownership in the work. If you have a cool idea or want to try something out, we want to hear it, and help you execute. 
Is curious and willing to learn
Will offer feedback and suggestions
Is independent – knows how to take initiative and creatively problem solve
Is deadline oriented – this position is fun and exciting, but work still needs to get done and our team could be relying on you!
Knows how to ask for help when they need it

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers' hands.

We're also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We're a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We're a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omni-channel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they're migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We're the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and communitainment tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We're Telnyx. We're the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns.

Through our Treetracker app, rural smallholder farmers in some of the most remote communities on the planet are able to earn a sustainable income by planting, caring for, and tracking trees. Each tree grower takes a geotagged photo of their tree and uploads it to the Treetracker’s verification system, where Greenstanders verify that each photographed tree is alive and growing. Verified trees are digitized as Impact Tokens, which can be traded or sold among other Impact Wallet users within the Treetracker app.

Nasiyan was our first Treetracker. A single mother living with extreme visual and hearing impairments, she could barely afford to keep food on the table for herself and her three sons. However, since she began growing and tracking trees with Greenstand, her life has been looking up. Her young forest has become a small biodiversity hotspot, and with the income she has earned from tracking trees, she can now afford to send her boys to school.

Are you interested in helping us fight climate change and extreme poverty? We’re interested in you! Please check out our open opportunities or shoot us an email at info@greenstand.org. We can’t wait to hear from you!
Greenstand is a fully remote social non-profit organization turning environmental stewardship into a reliable source of income. Our work tackles both extreme poverty and climate change. Our main product is Treetracker, a mobile app that allows planting organizations and their donors to track the growth of newly planted trees through periodic geotagged photos.

87,"Digital Marketing Intern","PathMatch","Los Angeles Metropolitan Area","Are you a student in the Classes of 2021-2025 interested in a career in Digital Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing.

Most students don’t realize how critical internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing skills in a classroom because most universities don’t offer Digital Marketing classes. And, you certainly won’t learn the strategies, processes, and technologies companies use unless you work within an internship.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where the first six weeks, students learn the fundamentals of digital marketing. In the second 6 weeks, you’ll be matched to a company where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Six weeks of curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement for six weeks with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.
