Star Program Description

Sustaining Technical and Analytic Resources (STAR) is a project of the Public Health Institute (PHI) in partnership with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). STAR is a Global Health talent hub. Through fellowships, internships, and strategic partnerships, STAR supports building the capacity of diverse global health professionals and organizations at all levels to make inclusive, collaborative, and innovative contributions to global health. STAR participants collaborate in the development of systems and tools that strengthen and sustain the local and global health response.

Background

INTERNSHIP DESCRIPTION

The Office of Population and Reproductive Health (PRH) advances and supports voluntary family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) programs worldwide to reduce unintended pregnancy and foster improved reproductive health behaviors. PRH provides strategic direction, global technical leadership and support to field programs; ensures responsiveness to Congressional and Administration priorities, directives and restrictions; and provides information on USAID’s family planning and reproductive health programs to a range of stakeholders.

Introduction

PRH identifies youth as an important priority population that requires specific attention so as to achieve the goals of GH’s signature initiatives, including FP2030, and Controlling the AIDS Epidemic and Preventing Child and Maternal Deaths (PCMD). The Service Delivery Improvement Division develops and applies innovative strategies that improve the performance of individuals, organizations and systems for the sustainable delivery of quality voluntary family planning and reproductive health services, including for young people. The Division has multiple global projects and strategic initiatives that combined, seek to strengthen health systems that improve family planning and health outcomes by increasing access to and use of high-quality voluntary family planning and health services, and products in the public and private sectors, delivered by trained, qualified health providers, community health workers, and social and behavior change communication agents.

PRH supports programming with youth as a population segment (10-29 years) and also as a period of life where important healthy behaviors are established for life. PRH supports activities that aim specifically to improve FP/RH information and services specifically for youth. Such activities can ensure youth and families have access to scientifically accurate information regarding puberty, respectful and equal relationships, reproduction, sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, preparation for future families and parenting, and voluntary family planning. Activities can also improve access to high-quality voluntary FP/RH services, address barriers to care-seeking, and work with health care providers to improve their ability to provide client-centered care to youth. Activities can also help youth advocate for themselves, become leaders in their communities to promote access for youth to FP/RH education and services or provide pathways to youth becoming professionals in the FP/RH field.

Reporting Structure

The Intern will work closely with the PRH/SDI Youth Team, reporting daily to the Sr. Youth Advisor or the Youth and Reproductive Health Advisor to plan, organize and coordinate tasks in the scope of work, and to engage closely in the daily work of the youth team. The Intern will receive technical guidance from the SDI Deputy Division Chief, who will serve as their Point of Contact.

OUTCOMES

By the end of the internship, the Intern will have gained experience and exposure to:
Enhanced technical expertise in family planning and reproductive health, specifically as it pertains to young people.
Experience in conducting program review, analysis, and preparation of a database of current FP/RH programming in up to 24 USAID PRH priority countries (e.g., desk review of USAID documents, select key informant interviews, review of themes).
Experience planning, managing, and guiding youth FP/RH activities in a team environment alongside USAID colleagues.


Essential Duties
Provide support and input to the coordination of FP/RH and other integrated youth activities and events.
Review, analyze and synthesize information about existing youth FP/RH programs in USAID priority countries, using the thematic review or other methodology developed with other youth team members.
Develop and populate an excel or Google-based database, or another similar tool, for youth programs by country and for key youth programming resources that can be updated annually.
Create a slide deck summary and analysis of programs reviewed.
Develop a follow-up survey instrument for key informant interviews with youth POCs or activity managers, to gain more insight into key features of ongoing successful youth FP/RH programming.
Review documents, technical writing products, or success stories from the various FP/RH activities managed by PRH and Missions with a youth focus in order to keep the Youth Team and PRH/GH as a whole abreast of youth-related accomplishments.
Keep abreast of new tools and resources related to youth FP/RH programming.
Participate in relevant team, division and office level meetings and events. The supervisor will provide opportunities for select technical training and topical webinars.

All STAR Interns will participate in learning activities (*approximately 10% time) during their internship. By the end of the internship, the Intern will be able to:
Gain exposure to FP/RH Programming and PRH Youth Activities through global health programming.

Position Description The rich history of African American people, cultures, and communities in Essex County,Massachusetts runs deep. This history is embedded in the cultural landscape, fromcemeteries to a renamed park in honor of two famed 19th century black abolitionists. EssexCounty residents, archivists, educators, interpreters, historians, and scholars alike have beenworking to unearth this history and recover these fascinating stories in order to provide afuller account of the county's past and present. In a span of nearly four hundred years, Blackpeople have shaped and been shaped by Essex County. However, real challenges, historicand contemporary, have thwarted the efforts of even the most enterprising and well-trainedexperts because much of this history is hidden, scattered or misplaced. And therein lies theopportunity and need that must be met. Because this history is hidden, residents andtourists alike fail to appreciate the fundamental role African Americans have played in thehistory of Essex County. In 2020, the two-year, grant-funded report, The African AmericanExperience in Essex County, Massachusetts: An Annotated Guide, was completed. Thepurpose of the report is to identify, locate, and compile the collections and resources,organizations, and individuals concerning the Black experience in Essex County. Our twoNational Park Service units in Essex County have sought to implement an inclusive,audience-centered interpretative approach that more prominently features the stories ofAfrican Americans. The report synthesizes key themes and offers suggestions for projectsand serves as a basis for developing historically sound, inclusive programming, fromexhibitions to school projects. African Americans and people of African descent stand tall inEssex County's past, present, and future. There are a wide range of stories and accounts ofBlack women in these collections and repositories. However, there is no singular Blackwoman's” story to be told. The intern would work within a theme of the diverse ways inwhich Black women built lives, careers, and families, as well as fought for change, survivedand resisted oppression, and spoke out boldly for themselves and others. The intern willresearch African American women of Essex County who operated within and outside ofsystems that were intended to reduce or limit them; Black women who were leaders ineducation, in business, in civic life, in family life, in activism. The research will focus on boththe names that are well-known and the countless women whose names history hasforgotten, but who nevertheless built and fueled the culture of Essex County for generations.In the Recommendations” section of the report, these are a few of the women suggested tobe researched: Charlotte Forten (Salem State University), Rose Lovejoy (Andover), FrancesCole Lee (Haverhill Public Library), Myrna Mitchell Brown (Lawrence), Sarah Remond (PhillipsLibrary), Juno Larcom (Historic Beverly), Agnes (Marblehead), and Sara Baro Colcher(Topsfield). While there are few complete collections of Black women's archival materials,African American women are not completely absent in the historical records. An exhibitcould make this explicit. Suggested ways an intern could tell the stories of the hundreds ofBlack women who have lived in Essex County who did not leave behind personal materials inthe archives include:
Using names from Massachusetts Vital Records and selecting somefrom Essex County to trace through Marriage, Births, and Deaths;
telling the story of Blackwomen who had accounts at the Salem Savings Bank using the records available throughthe Salem State University Archives; and
giving voice to the stories of Black women who were incarcerated at Essex County Jail. The intern will be responsible for researching,planning, drafting, and proposing an exhibit for the Salem Armory Visitor Center that couldalso travel to historic sites and museums in Essex County. Qualifications The intern should ideally be working toward a graduate degree in history or a related field, and have course work, experience, or interest in African American history, public history, education, and/or interpretation. The intern must have strong oral and written communication skills and some experience in working in the archives and/or at museum/historic site settings.

49,"Research and Dissemination Summer Intern 2021","The Primary School","San Francisco, CA","About The Organization

The Primary School is expanding the boundaries of traditional education. Our holistic model weaves together education, health, and family support services to ensure underserved children have the system of care they need to lead meaningful and emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy lives. The Primary School was founded in 2015, supported by seed funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a major national philanthropy.

Our Approach Has Three Defining Characteristics
We start early. We start working with parents and enroll children into our program as early as 12 months to reach them at their most critical stage in development.
We work with - not around - families. We know that parents and caregivers are the most important people in a child's life. We partner with them to enhance the education and health of their children.
We integrate multiple systems to serve the whole child. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.

In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four-year-olds. We have grown to serve over 300 children and their families via a 0-3 parent/child program, a preschool and elementary school, and a parent wellness program.

Our ultimate goal is to create a game-changing system of care for children that can be replicated across the country. To that end, we are building a model that can be effectively implemented in diverse communities and sustained on public funding. In 2020 we expanded our student and family population in East Palo Alto and opened our next site in Hayward, California. In 2021, we will be piloting our Bridge to Preschool program in San Francisco for the first time. It's an exciting time to join the team!

About The Role

The Primary School internship program is a paid summer internship for current undergraduate/ graduate students interested in exploring nonprofit management careers at the intersection of education, health and family support. During the 10-12 week program, interns engage in hands-on, project-based learning, and also participate in high-impact developmental and networking programming. This includes opportunities to build meaningful relationships with other interns, TPS staff, and the broader TPS family and East Palo Alto/San Francisco community.

The Partnerships and Dissemination Intern will work closely with our Research, Design, Dissemination and Policy team, as well as our Birth to Three team and our San Francisco partners.

You will also participate in learning and design sessions with our SF team and partner agencies around early intervention, social-emotional learning, early childhood mental health, and family engagement. You will gain experience in program codification and project management. You will also work with our data team to collect, analyze, present, and facilitate usage of data. This is a great opportunity for a student seeking to learn more about program execution and policy work in early education, and what it looks like to partner with different stakeholders to accomplish our goals.

We validate the students by valuing hip-hop culture. Through the development of intergenerational relationships rooted in hip-hop culture, Academy staff work closely with the students as coaches and mentors. These relationships allow the teaching artists to share their talents and skills as a means of increasing the students cognitive, communication, and interpersonal skills.

Reports to: Program Manager/Director of Site

The People's Music School is a 45-year old institution that has brought the transformative benefits of music to over 10,000 lives across Chicago. Our model is completely tuition-free. We serve kids age 5-18 who otherwise would not be able to afford music education. Since music education has benefits that extend far beyond the artistic benefits, we view ourselves as an institution building future leaders. We build cognitive, academic, and social-emotional skills through an intense and rigorous curriculum. Our students learn with us for up to 12 hours per week and their families fulfill a significant volunteer time requirement. The school has grown 2x under new leadership composed of alumni from Bain & Company and world-class experience from a newly energized Board of Directors. And we're just getting started...
