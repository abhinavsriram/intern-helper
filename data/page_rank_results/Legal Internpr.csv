Position Purpose And Objectives

The work assigned primarily consists of legal research, analysis, and writing. The goals of the program are (i) for the interns to learn about the daily functioning of a state trial court; (ii) for the interns to develop research and writing skills, and leave the internship with at least one original writing sample; and (iii) for the interns to foster networking opportunities in the Summit and Eagle County legal communities for possible future employment. Interns will engage in one on one and small group discussions with District Court Judges to receive detailed feedback on their work product as well as to facilitate understanding of what they are witnessing in the various courtrooms.

Students are expected to spend at least ten hours per week on their research and writing projects but may work up to forty hours a week if required by their school’s internship program requirements. As a guiding principle, the Court recommends that interns work ten to thirty hours per week. The research and writing portion of the program may be done remotely depending on the present state of the COVID-19 pandemic. Every effort will be made to ensure that interns receive valuable mentorship and benefit from their experience with the judicial branch.
