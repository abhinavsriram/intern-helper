Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch UI/UX/Product Design Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into the massive field of user experience & user interface.

Most students don’t realize how critical internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late.  But here’s the issue. You don’t learn UI/UX design skills in a classroom and certainly won’t learn the processes and technologies modern companies use.

The PathMatch UI/UX Design Accelerator is a 12-week program where you'll learn UI/UX Design fundamentals such as usability, interface design, iconography, user research methodologies, as well as, learn how to use tools such as Figma and Sketch and applying what you're learning in a guaranteed full-time internship with one of our corporate partners.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. This cohort starts on May 24th.

NOTE: Due to the training intensive and company matching, this program costs $2,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship (you'll make $7,200 over 12 weeks) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

WHAT YOU GET: 
• Develop career-specific skills not taught in college classes
• Get mentoring from experts in their field
• Build experience through a 12-week internship 
• Add relevant experience to your resume
• Prepare for the upcoming 2022 internship/job search process that begins in August
• Learn the hiring timelines and processes of top companies
• Improve interview skills crucial to landing top internships and jobs

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
• Learning the main constructs of UI/UX design and how they're applied within companies
• Conducting & synthesizing user research
• Build an online portfolio of work to share with future employers
• Learning and applying color theory, typography, iconography to real-world projects
• Build prototypes and wireframes
• Developing efficient and strategic design tools

WHAT YOU NEED:
• Have an interest in working in UI/UX/Product Design
• Ability to work 40 hours per week
• Pursuing an undergraduate degree
• Hard worker and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.

As a member of the Host Work design team, we deliver engaging and delightful experiences in the form of mobile and desktop digital products. We work the full breadth of the design process, from discovery to development documentation at hand off. Our product offering is unique, bringing our workplaces up to the standards of the new digital landscape. Smart home feature users are comfortable interacting through our product to help control their workplace experience. Using emerging and established programs, we love showing just what the future of the workplace looks like.

Position Objectives

Iterative Design on Digital Navigation

Conduct Qualitative and Quantitative user research to discover and present insights on current user experience

Use rapid prototyping techniques to develop, validate, and iterate on hypothesis created based on the insights found during user research

Organize and present findings from the iterations to design, product, and engineering leadership

Using the existing design system, create high fidelity prototypes that elaborate on both macro and micro-interactions to help create a holistic experience for users

Prepare thoughtful documentation on the designed experience to assist in the smooth transition from the design team to our engineering partners

Collaborate with engineering partners to test and QA the experience, ensuring any questions are met with a shared understanding of the ideal solution

Organizational Structure

The UI/UX Design Intern will be reporting to the UI/UX Design Lead, under the UX Design Center of Excellence. In addition, there is immense collaboration between the Design, Product Management, and Engineering teams.

We are agile, collaborative, and driven to bring exciting digital solutions to our clients and their employees. Because we are a young product, there is a set of unique and exciting challenges to solve as part of the design team.

Technological Needs and Challenges

Because our product is young, we need to be agile and quickly adapt to market changes. This means pivoting on a moment’s notice, and delivering fast, sometimes forgoing some of the typical design process. We use these opportunities to help flex our design system’s muscle and adapt to the needs as they arise.

Team Structure Needs and Challenges

Our team is spread across two continents with both on-and-offshore teams working concurrently to deliver award winning solutions. In addition to the usual challenges, we have become remote during the COVID-19 Pandemic, though there are plans to return to in-person collaboration down the line. Host Work mostly has its sea legs under us in terms of digital collaboration but starting a new position fully remote can be a challenge.
