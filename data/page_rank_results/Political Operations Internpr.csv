TL;DR: Fast-growing early-stage startup seeking Operations Intern. In doing so, we’ll empower the most ambitious people in the world to build the future. Details below!

About On Deck

On Deck is where ambitious people grow, together.

On Deck is where the world's top talent comes to connect. Whatever it is our fellows want to do next, our ever-growing community and action-oriented programming will help them get there—fast. If our fellows want to learn something new to up-level their career, launch and scale big ideas, or make lifelong friends, this is the place.

Role Overview

Punchline: We're looking for all-star operations interns to help our Program Directors launch and run our new Fellowship programs .

You may have seen, we're launching a lot of new Fellowship programs ! :) Each one becomes a critical piece of the interweaving flywheel of products we're building at On Deck.

When considering launching new programs, we ask ourselves: does this make the broader On Deck ecosystem stronger, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts?

For every program we've launched thus far, we see the potential for it to become a multi-million dollar business line.

We're looking for operations interns to help our Operations Generalists and Program Directors bring their programs from 0 to 1.

Responsibilities

Programs don't happen without the Operations team executing on every last detail — that's where you come in.

You’ll work directly with a Program Director from On Deck Labs, the Operations Generalist, and Regina Gerbeaux (Head of Fellowship Operations) on all things operations-related.

On this team, you'll work on the program structure, events & opportunities we offer to Fellows.

We’re looking for a force of nature; someone who will do whatever it takes — both strategically & tactically — to make a massive positive impact on our fellows' lives.

This is an incredibly exciting role, with lots of opportunities to learn, get your hands dirty, take on lots of responsibility from Day One, and bring something from a mere concept into a full-fledged profitable business unit.

The team is growing extremely fast, so you'll get an inside seat at a company in rapid scaling mode.

As such, we're also looking to hire for these roles ASAP. If you're ready to move fast, so are we. Let's chat.

Who You Are
High output, execution, and hustle – an ability to own all operations, and an eagerness to dive into the nitty-gritty
Passionate about startups & constantly learning about tech.
Thrives in a fast-paced, often scrappy, sometimes chaotic environment.
Natural community-builder – understands the long-game, and how to cultivate positive-sum value.
Has a strong spirit of service, where you think first how you can give rather than take, and always seeking opportunities to support Fellows to the max of your ability.
Serious about inclusion and creating a safe & welcoming space for all members of our community.
Meticulously detail-oriented and organized – able to juggle many priorities while not dropping any balls.
Great interpersonal skills, charisma, and enjoys building new relationships.
Strong communication skills - verbal, written and presentation.
Our team lives and breathes Slack & Zoom — our fellowships' central gathering places are a highly active Slack community & a lively calendar of Zoom events. We're looking for team members who are comfortable with both tools or can ramp up quickly. Other tools you should be familiar with or ready to ramp up on include Zapier and Airtable.

What You Will Do
We treat interns the same as full-timers and give you an immense amount of autonomy, responsibility and impact.
You will work on everything Ops including:
Fellowship Programming Calendar — everything from designing the experience to booking guests to hosting interviews).
New events & initiatives — design & launch experiments to help fellows work together, learn from each other, and connect).
Sweat the small stuff — ensuring we give fellows & speakers a highly professional experience with every last detail prepared, from intro email to thank-you message.
Event execution — manage all event logistics, communications, and details with a strong attention to detail.
Build dozens (maybe hundreds) of new relationships, connections, and an experience that is truly one-of-a-kind connecting top technology Founders & Investors with Fellows from around the world.
You'll work within our no-code stack to set up automations, infrastructure, and landing pages for new programs (we'll help you learn, if you aren't already familiar)
Create the conditions such that each Program Director is set up to create incredible new Fellowships, while also ensuring Fellows have a mind-blowing experience, unlike any other community they've ever been part of.
Assist Program Director in coordinating with the tech ecosystem at large to provide world-class programming and mentorship – building relationships with fellows, guest speakers, event partners, and more.
Ultimately, ensuring fellows have a mind-blowing experience unlike any other community they've ever been part of.
The Labs team will be here for you. Any question, any ask, any meeting, anything you need — we will block time to make it happen.

Why Might Excite You About Us
We’re tackling a big problem with even bigger potential. Participants in our existing Fellowships say great things about us .
You’ll be able to work remotely and (mostly) set your own schedule. On Deck was a remote-first team even before COVID, so we know what makes for a great remote environment.
You'll have a lot of flexibility in your role, and will be able to help define what our operations infrastructure looks like going forward.
We're backed by a who’s who of the biggest names in the venture investing world, including Village Global, Keith Rabois, Balaji Srinivasan, Bloomberg Beta, and so many more. (Read more about our fundraise and 50-year vision here .)

Why you might *not* be excited about us:
We are still a fairly young company with about 100 people, so if you like more established companies, this role isn’t for you. You'll help create our company's culture.
We're an early stage startup. Projects and priorities are likely to shift.
Everyone on the team is extremely mission-driven, and works incredibly hard to push towards our lofty ambitions. Most people won’t be cut out for it.
You should be comfortable with just a dash of chaos. This is not the kind of job where you show up and we tell you exactly what to do every day.
On Deck is an unabashedly pro-startup, pro-tech organization. If that’s not your thing, this isn’t the place for you.

Location, start date and compensation:

This is a paid, full-time internship for 3 months. Start date is flexible, but we prioritize folks who are ready to start ASAP.

Our team works remotely, but you will have to be available to work on U.S.-friendly hours, which may be difficult from Europe or Asia.

Our program includes some weekend and evening events, which you would be expected to attend.

You would start as soon as possible.

Important

Please note, the application questions are the most important part of this application. We will be reviewing them closely to determine who will move on in our hiring process. Please answer thoughtfully and take your time.

Summary

In summary, On Deck may not be the place for you if

If you were to join On Deck, we'd want you to love it. We also know that it can be hard to tell from the outside looking in whether that would be the case for you. So, we challenged ourselves to develop an honest set of reasons someone wouldn't want to join our company . We hope it helps you make an informed decision about whether On Deck is a place you'd love to work.

Another company's mission gets you way more fired up.
You want a 9-5 job.
You do your best work in highly-structured, steady-paced, and meticulously-planned environments.
You like finding and poking holes more than you like filling them.
You see differences as divisions.

Backed by leading FinTech VC investors and based in New York City and Toronto, Baselane is a banking platform and financial hub for the real estate industry - we are starting with independent landlords.

There are 11 million independent landlords that own over 25 million homes in the United States. Financial service & technology providers have consistently underserved this segment - not offering them the specialized products, tools, and data they need to efficiently manage their finances and successfully grow their portfolios. As a result, independent landlords are forced to rely on manual processes and fragmented solutions not built for the way they manage their real estate investments.

Our mission is to empower the next generation of independent landlords through financial technology - providing landlords with tailored financial services, automated tools, and actionable insights to help them save time, increase their returns, and grow their investment portfolios.

We are a seasoned founding team (BCG, Wharton, INSEAD alumni) with deep experience in financial services and technology, with multiple exits.

Are you a college or high school student ready to demonstrate your skills in a job that helps you gain great experience? Love doing whatever it takes and performing a variety of tasks? Want to have an incredibly fun, unforgettable summer? Consider a role at our newly redesigned, COVID-safe camp—same joyful Galileo vibe, with thoughtful new safety precautions for all.

About Galileo

Galileo’s mission is to develop innovators who envision and create a better world. We know it’s bold. We also know that we can’t achieve it without asking staff to be role models of an innovator’s mindset—visionary, courageous, collaborative, determined, and reflective. It’s not always easy. Camp staffers work hard and bring camp magic to life—for campers, and for themselves.

This isn’t your average summer teaching gig. Galileans are expected to take ownership of their own performance and make this place better every day. People with a can-do attitude thrive here and those with a victim mentality don't. We manage to keep this level of performance expectation high in a relaxed environment; we take our work, not ourselves, seriously.

Galileans know what it means to be a vital part of a team. Galileans want to grow. Galileans like to have fun at work. Galileans love sharing in—and helping to create—joyful experiences. After all, we run summer camps. You get the point.

We value having divergent thinkers who bring various experiences and viewpoints to the table at Galileo. We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.

Program Description

Due to COVID-19, our traditional Camp Galileo model has been reimagined for Summer 2021 and replaced with a new structure focused on camper safety and joy, featuring stable groups of 12 campers (that remain physically distanced from other groups), and consistent staff for each week-long session. Each group will rotate between three assigned spaces (primarily outdoors) and a home base where campers can spread out and partake in the day's activities. Campers will play fun games and engage in hands-on activities that encourage them to learn via our unique pedagogy—the Galileo Innovation Approach (or the GIA).

Position Overview

Galileo would not function without Summer Interns. Their ability to switch focus from week to week, day to day, hour to hour, and sometimes minute to minute is critical to the successful operation of camp. This role requires a positive, solution-oriented attitude, initiative, flexibility, and exceptional service mentality. And in the new iteration of our classic Summer Intern role, you’ll have the opportunity to level up professionally, participate in the scaling of our exciting new in-person camp models, and greater responsibility over administrative tasks (like lesson materials prep and surface sanitization).

What You’ll Get

Purposeful work on an innovative team, along with the opportunity to expand upon or develop hands-on program iteration skills. Plus, you’ll be a part of a supportive community that stands for innovation, credibility, and expertise. We’re a certified B Corporation that is ranked #1 on the Best Places to Work in the Bay Area list, were named one of Forbes’ Best Small Companies and a Top 100 Impact Company, and are authentically committed to inclusion and equity company-wide—which includes joyfully upholding a robust financial assistance program.

About Great Jones

Great Jones brings ease and performance to rental ownership and living, starting by reinventing property management for the several trillion (!) dollars in rental homes owned by small-scale investors.

We're replacing an experience that has historically been heavily operational, low-tech, and stressful with one delivered through modern software, thoughtful experience design, real benefits of scale, and the right blend of local & centralized operations.

By providing a seamless, full-service experience for owners and residents, we aim to make ownership worry-free and more profitable for the 25 million Americans who own rental homes. In doing so, we become the operating system around our owners' most valuable investments, as well as our residents' homes.

And we're doing this within an enormous addressable market, with highly attractive unit economics, where competition is deeply fragmented and notorious for subpar service.

We are growing rapidly with nationwide expansion on deck -- headquartered in Manhattan with on-the-ground operations in 20 markets across 9 states.

Our leadership team has built digital platforms and operational machines that have powered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of transactions for marketplace businesses like 1stdibs, Skillshare, and Warby Parker.

We've raised over $30 million (including our recently closed Series B) from top investors including Crosslink Capital, Navitas Capital, Zigg Capital, Juxtapose, and top NYC angels & real estate entrepreneurs including Kevin Ryan, David Rosenblatt, and Jason Finger, who have founded or led companies such as Seamless, Gilt Groupe, MongoDB, DoubleClick, 1stdibs, Floored, and others.","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2495150666?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgrnh%2Ese%2F426ea1f63us&urlHash=RCa7&refId=1165ef16-d4bc-43f4-8fd0-65582514378a&trackingId=aUjEDA%2BlP1kzNWmuqSqKCQ%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite",0.0017266854060619967,

217,"Summer Camp Operations Intern","Galileo Learning","Sierra Madre, CA","US-CA-Sierra Madre

Are you a college or high school student ready to demonstrate your skills in a job that helps you gain great experience? Love doing whatever it takes and performing a variety of tasks? Want to have an incredibly fun, unforgettable summer? Consider a role at our newly redesigned, COVID-safe camp—same joyful Galileo vibe, with thoughtful new safety precautions for all.

About Galileo

Galileo’s mission is to develop innovators who envision and create a better world. We know it’s bold. We also know that we can’t achieve it without asking staff to be role models of an innovator’s mindset—visionary, courageous, collaborative, determined, and reflective. It’s not always easy. Camp staffers work hard and bring camp magic to life—for campers, and for themselves.

This isn’t your average summer teaching gig. Galileans are expected to take ownership of their own performance and make this place better every day. People with a can-do attitude thrive here and those with a victim mentality don't. We manage to keep this level of performance expectation high in a relaxed environment; we take our work, not ourselves, seriously.

Galileans know what it means to be a vital part of a team. Galileans want to grow. Galileans like to have fun at work. Galileans love sharing in—and helping to create—joyful experiences. After all, we run summer camps. You get the point.

We value having divergent thinkers who bring various experiences and viewpoints to the table at Galileo. We strongly encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.

Program Description

Due to COVID-19, our traditional Camp Galileo model has been reimagined for Summer 2021 and replaced with a new structure focused on camper safety and joy, featuring stable groups of 12 campers (that remain physically distanced from other groups), and consistent staff for each week-long session. Each group will rotate between three assigned spaces (primarily outdoors) and a home base where campers can spread out and partake in the day's activities. Campers will play fun games and engage in hands-on activities that encourage them to learn via our unique pedagogy—the Galileo Innovation Approach (or the GIA).

Position Overview

Galileo would not function without Summer Interns. Their ability to switch focus from week to week, day to day, hour to hour, and sometimes minute to minute is critical to the successful operation of camp. This role requires a positive, solution-oriented attitude, initiative, flexibility, and exceptional service mentality. And in the new iteration of our classic Summer Intern role, you’ll have the opportunity to level up professionally, participate in the scaling of our exciting new in-person camp models, and greater responsibility over administrative tasks (like lesson materials prep and surface sanitization).

What You’ll Get

Purposeful work on an innovative team, along with the opportunity to expand upon or develop hands-on program iteration skills. Plus, you’ll be a part of a supportive community that stands for innovation, credibility, and expertise. We’re a certified B Corporation that is ranked #1 on the Best Places to Work in the Bay Area list, were named one of Forbes’ Best Small Companies and a Top 100 Impact Company, and are authentically committed to inclusion and equity company-wide—which includes joyfully upholding a robust financial assistance program.
