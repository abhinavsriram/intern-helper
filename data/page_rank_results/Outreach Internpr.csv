It is recognized that immigrant women are at higher risk for domestic violence due to their immigration status. They face an increasingly difficult time escaping abuse. Immigrant women often feel trapped in abusive relationships because of the intimidation used by their abusers regarding immigration laws; often there significant language barriers, imposed social isolation, and lack of financial resources.

While we have come a long way in recognizing and addressing the needs of women victims of domestic violence as there still remains a massive gap between funding and call for adequate services. As more and more women search to escape from life threatening situations, it is imperative that we develop ways to meet their needs.

Addressing the two most important steps in recovery; by allowing women to break the silence (the first step in moving from abuse) and to know they are not alone (breaking the isolation).

131,"Education and Community Outreach Intern - Latino Heritage Internship Program","Fire Island National Seashore/Division of Interpretation, Education and Volunteers","Patchogue, NY","This professional development opportunity is an education and community outreach internship at Fire Island National Seashore. The primary tasks and deliverables associated with the internship will be to assist with media development; and provide community outreach, interpretive and education programming at the park, in communities and virtually, with a special focus on engaging local underserved populations and underrepresented audiences. While gateway communities to the park, such as Patchogue, are ethnically and socio-economically diverse, with large Latino populations, this demographic is not well represented in park visitors or park staff.

Based on studies conducted by the Environment for the Americas, as well as recent conversations with local Latino community leaders, this may be due to a lack of awareness of what the park has to offer, and its relevance to the needs and interests of local community residents. Engaging a broader demographic is a primary park goal identified in the Seashore’s General Management Plan (2016), Visitor Experience Plan (2017) and Strategic Plan (2020).

The Latino Heritage Intern will play a critical role in furthering the park’s efforts to engage Latino audiences and other underserved populations. It will also enable the park to support the National Park Service-wide goals outlined in the “Achieving Relevance in Our Second Century” strategy, including fostering the next generation of NPS stewards. Community outreach using a variety of virtual platforms will be a key component of the internship. The Latino Heritage Intern will contribute to social media and the development of bilingual information and programming about park resources, visitor experiences, and youth employment opportunities. Effort will be dedicated to a media campaign and programming celebrating Latino Conservation Week. This may include hosting a stewardship opportunity or recreational family day at the park, and/or conducting virtual Spanish language or bilingual programs for local libraries, churches and community enrichment programs.

Along with park staff, the intern will staff community fairs such as Patchogue’s “Family Fun Night,” and career fairs at local schools and colleges, and assist with offsite programming in other under-served communities on Long Island. The intern will work alongside National Park Service Park Rangers at park visitor centers to assist with park programs and visitor operations. These opportunities will help orient the intern to park resources and the visitor experience, as well as provide a place-based venue for developing and practicing communication skills.

The intern will assist with programs and media geared for youth and general public audiences on a variety of topics including marine life, recreational fishing, barrier island ecology, shoreline dynamics, maritime and American history, and more. Once the intern gains adequate content knowledge and progresses with interpretive skills development, she/he will be encouraged to lead programs and develop media on park topics of interest. He/she will also help plan for, implement, and participate in volunteer and partner events such as fishing clinics, coastal cleanups, and native plant/pollinator gardening days.

At the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the recruitment and employment of
staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity,
with due regard to geographic diversity. All employment decisions are made on the basis of
qualifications and organizational needs. The United Nations is committed to creating a diverse
and inclusive environment of mutual respect. The United Nations recruits and employs staff
regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religious, cultural and ethnic
backgrounds or disabilities. Reasonable accommodation for applicants with disabilities may
be provided to support participation in the recruitment process when requested and indicated
in the application.

Interns are not financially remunerated by the United Nations. Costs and arrangements for
travel, visas, accommodation and living expenses are the responsibility of interns or their
sponsoring institutions. For internships in the United States of America, interns who are not
United States citizens, permanent residents or not currently in the United States on a nonimmigrant
visa status will be required to obtain a G-4 visa. If already in the United States of
America on another non-immigrant visa status other than G-4, interns will be responsible for
ensuring that they have a valid visa, and if required, employment authorization, allowing them
to undertake the internship.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

Applicants are urged to follow carefully all instructions available in the online recruitment platform, inspira.
