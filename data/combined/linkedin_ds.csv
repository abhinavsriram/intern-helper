Data Science Intern,Optimus Consulting Group LLC,"Alexandria, VA","Intern Job Description:

Øptimus Analytics, a data science and software company, is seeking a data science intern in their Washington D.C. area office or remotely for the summer term. Interns with the Data Science & Predictive Analytics team will participate in all aspects of work at Øptimus. In an environment where a “long-term” project lasts one or two weeks, no two days are the same. You won't be getting coffee. You'll sit in on meetings and work on multiple projects: writing call scripts that are used in hundreds of thousands of calls, streamlining our current workflow, and creating statistical models to meet the needs of our clients, just to name a few. You'll be doing the work that a full-time employee does. We'll match what you're good at with what you enjoy and what we need.

Our internships are mostly geared towards those still in school, whether undergraduate or graduate students as well as recent graduates. This job posting is for the summer 2021 period, with flexible starting dates between May and June full time preferred but part-time considered. We don't guarantee full-time employment after an internship, but we're a growing firm and are always looking for bright, hard-working talent. If you're looking for a full-time job, this is a good first step and puts you ahead of the competition!

Qualifications:

Must be able to learn quickly and juggle multiple projects with moving deadlines.
Must have strong analytical skills.
Must have at least one course in quantitative research such as statistics or applied research.
Must have courses or experience in machine learning, data mining, regression, generalized linear models, experimental design, and/or GIS
Must have killer Excel skills and be incredibly competent in Word, PowerPoint
Must have experience in R or Python - both are a plus!
Experience with computer programming is a plus.
Experience with statistical modeling is a plus.

Compensation:

Internships with Øptimus are paid commensurate with professional and academic experience on a 1099 basis.

Company:

Øptimus Analytics is a family of statisticians, graphic designers, data scientists, programmers, social media marketing analysts, and recovering politicos. Since its founding in 2013, Øptimus has been at the forefront of developing innovative data and analytics software platforms. Øptimus has designed and delivered data-driven strategies for leading political campaigns, Fortune 500 companies, and non-profits around the globe.

We handle a wide variety of projects and use many different technologies and programs to meet our clients' needs, so our culture here is one of constant learning and curiosity, while doing things the right way. We boast office space in a beautiful building on the Old Town Alexandria waterfront near the yellow and blue Metro lines, no cubicles, a nacho cheese machine, and free staff lunch on Wednesdays. If you work remotely with Øptimus, you will be provided with a company issued laptop and the same training, tools and support offered to our in-office staff. If you live by the ""work hard, play hard"" philosophy, then you'll be a great fit with the Øptimus team.

Work with our engineering team to enhance the quality, robustness, and extensibility of our platform for millions of patients

Work with our advisors and keep up to date on relevant literature to ensure we use the best approaches available
