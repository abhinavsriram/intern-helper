**Job Description**
*A Growth Stage Venture Firm Opportunity*
Our Summer Investment Analyst program focuses on teaching analysts about the venture and PE investing business. You will receive training on how to best speak to entrepreneurs, different business models that are attractive to Insight, how deals are structured, and the lifecycle of a deal. You will be supported during the summer by an analyst mentor, your team members, and partners. By the end of your 10-week internship, you will have evaluated hundreds of business and business models, gained industry and market expertise, and developed an understanding of the entire venture investment cycle.
Few leading investment organizations offer the type of opportunity that Insight Venture Partners offers our interns. The life blood of our organization is sourcing, and you will be immediately thrust into the chaotic world of venture funded business. You will be speaking with entrepreneurs every day, learning from them, questioning them, and ultimately recommending if their business is worth considering for investment.
*Sourcing venture businesses is not easy work*
Funding growth stage venture business in the technology space today is not easy work.

You will develop investment theses and, over time, develop deal judgement. It will be critical for you to be able to cultivate strong relationships with entrepreneurs and demonstrate the value that Insight provides these companies before, during, and after the fund raising process. This will be your focus as a Summer Analyst.
**Get involved with deals** - When a deal goes live, you will be exposed to the evaluation process, negotiations, and due diligence. You may also have a role in performing industry and market research, financial modeling, and customer analytics.
**Developing investment memos** - All of the work up to this point comes together in an investment memo which lays out both the risks and merits of a transaction. Here you will learn to present both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of a deal.
**Find great M&A targets** - Many of our growth and PE investments rely upon successful acquisitions to bolster top line growth. You will learn how to identify synergistic M&A targets, how these deals might be structured, and how the post-acquisition company might be organized.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2488025777?url=https%3A%2F%2Fus%2Ejobrapido%2Ecom%2Fjobpreview%2F1767254318%3Futm_campaign%3Dlinkedin_apply%26utm_source%3Dlinkedin_apply%26utm_medium%3Dorganic&urlHash=KxCZ&refId=85e08770-cbaa-4e98-a295-3ff335156626&trackingId=aTMpHIENxSndWgb%2FGjF3QA%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite
