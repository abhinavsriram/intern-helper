"Fall 2019, Consulting Intern, Mental Health Incubator | Harvard Innovation...",Ignite Mental Health,"Boston, MA","Do you want to learn how to improve the world? Ever wonder what it would be like to be able to get in at the ground level working at a world-changing organization just as they started growing rapidly with a team of less than twenty? Do you want to be a part of building an organization helping mental health entrepreneurs and ChangeMakers as they scale to impact the lives of 1000's, 100,000's or 1,000,000's and secure $XX M+ funding?

At Ignite Mental Health we're mobilizing, supporting, and uniting mental health entrepreneurs/ organizations while concurrently mobilizing students at scale, to achieve Three Utopian Mental Health Goals. Using this novel approach, we're working to make the impossible inevitable; helping build and scale breakthrough organizations and movements to be as impactful as Facebook and Google but in addressing the root causes of some of the biggest problems affecting mental health!

Become a member of a mission-driven founding team that grew rapidly from the Harvard and MIT communities with the help of the Harvard Innovation Labs Venture Incubation Program, to become a nationwide effort in just 9 months!

As a member of the Ignite team, you will perch atop a world-changing organization and have the opportunity to learn, grow, and hopefully thrive in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial, and impact-driven environment. On a daily basis, you will likely find yourself exposed to new perspectives, developing and growing in ways you did't expect you would!

If you're looking for a structured, predictable, and hold-your-hand type environment, Ignite unfortunately won't be it! Tenacity, a go-getter/self-starter mentality, and a willingness to speak up and fully embrace radical candor are essentials. As too is the desire to work in a nimble fast-paced startup, where bottlenecks, imperfect processes, and growing pains are the norm on the road to world-changing success.

Curious about how transformative and unique your experience with us could potentially be? Find out for yourself by contacting any of our past or current interns on LinkedIn!

FYI talent comes in all forms and sizes, we’re not easily dazzled by big-brand schools or companies. We are dazzled by people who genuinely want to improve the world and who have the growth mindset and chops to make it happen!

Our ambition is to help build organizations, movements and products —unafraid of transforming traditional approaches—that tackle the root causes of some of the biggest problems affecting mental health.
