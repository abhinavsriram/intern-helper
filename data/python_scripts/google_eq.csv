The curriculum will focus on key Associate building blocks - basic financial modeling, dissecting a company’s future business prospects, and distinguishing between good and bad businesses and attractive and unattractive investment opportunities, among other areas. It will also provide extensive exposure to Citadel’s best-in-class infrastructure, allowing participants to understand how the right technology investing applications and risk management systems help drive repeatable investing process and best in class performance.

• Investment team rotations will give our interns the chance to perform bespoke research projects while reporting directly to analysts and portfolio managers across different industry groups.

• Our team stock pitch will expose interns to what executing an investment process looks like – identifying an attractive investment opportunity and learning how to build and then convey conviction in front of a panel of program leaders and other Citadel investment professionals.
