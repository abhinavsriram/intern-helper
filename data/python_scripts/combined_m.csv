Remote Marketing and Communications Internships,Virtual Internships,Anywhere,"Why Complete a Remote Marketing Opportunity?

Around the global, marketing can take on analytical and business roles of planning budgets, ad spends, forecasting return on investment and more as well as the creative side of advertising, social media, campaign management and more. Both focuses are delivered through specific departments across industries or in specific marketing agencies or consultancies. Supporting marketing as a virtual intern is so much more than delivering a social media campaign and can include research and analysis, design and creativity, content development, and project management.

Think about how many advertisements you come across in your day to day life - including channels like

TV, radio, podcasts, and physical ads all around your town. This last area is greatly enhanced if you live in a city, where advertisements can be found on billboards, trains, buses, benches, in windows - you name it! In fact some cities like New York City and Tokyo have built their “image” off of the vast array of public advertisements in their metro areas. Any company that wants to sell a good or service has to find creative and intriguing ways to market it, and major corporations are more than willing to spend millions and, in some cases billions, on top-notch ad campaigns, market research, and creative teams. Those interested in getting their feet wet in the vast industries of creative marketing, advertising, SEO, and brand awareness will find great opportunity with Virtual Internships. Our host companies seek to market everything from wellness supplements, to makeup, to electric cars, to KPop concerts, to cultural tours, and so much more!

Sample Placements
• Support a UK based recruitment agency to work closely with the UK Country Manager to design sales pitches, such as videos, for the purpose of stakeholders' engagement; Develop relationships with key stakeholders, both internal and external, in the UK, Spain and Italy.
• Support a US based tech manufacturing company to create and manage digital input for social media platforms and monitor/report on engagement on a weekly basis; Create new case studies and marketing materials and presentations
