2021 Summer Internship - Creative Intern,RAPP,"New York, NY","Who We Are

We think too much marketing isn't us. It's mass markets not audiences of one. Homogenous groups to be targeted, not individuals to be inspired. Segments to reach, not people with their own ideas and ambitions. It's one size fits all and it's dull.

When it comes to individuals, we're fierce. We stand up for individuality. We speak up against bland, broad-brush generalizations. We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual's needs, beliefs, behaviors and aspirations. And we commit to doing this in every aspect of our work for clients and their consumers.

We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency's vision. And most importantly we value every individual's wellbeing.

We are Fiercely Individual.

As a guiding ethos, RAPP stands up for Individuality. So much so, that it's in our agency value proposition. We're committed to racial justice, equality, representation and unbiased economic opportunity, because we know that the strength of our diversity helps us create our best work. And we believe in harnessing the strength of all our Fiercely Individual people, and the differences among us, because that's the surest way to positively impact our business and network culture.

How We Do It

At RAPP, we are fiercely focused on the individual and how we can create value from every individual's experience with a brand. We do this across three capability areas: customer centric consulting, creativity that inspires action, and customer experience management.

Our data analysts know who that person is. Our strategists understand what they want. And our award-winning Technologists and Creatives know how to get it to them.

RAPP is an integral part of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group, comprising 4,000 creatives, technologists, strategists, and data and marketing scientists across 40 global markets.

The Internship

Our interns are sharp and can think both strategically and creatively no matter what discipline they're assigned to. During this 10-week program, you will:
Work on day-to-day client business
Participate in an intern team project & pitch presentation
Experience a curriculum of lunch & learns to gain deeper understanding of the agency world

When you are part of the Creative department, you have two main jobs. Come up with cool stuff, and sell that cool stuff.

Copywriter Intern Responsibilities

Social Media Marketing Intern,PathMatch,Los Angeles Metropolitan Area,"Are you interested in a career in Digital Marketing with a focus on Social Media Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing. This matched internship has a larger emphasis on Social Media Marketing. Students will be focused on both organic and paid social.

Most students don’t realize how critical corporate internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing or Social Media Marketing skills in a classroom. Companies look for experience working on live campaigns.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where you'll learn the fundamentals of digital marketing and get matched to an internship with our corporate partner where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.

Performance Marketing Intern,Dispute,"Chicago, IL","**Role**
We're looking to hire a Marketing Intern at Dispute, a new 2 person startup.

**What we do***
Our mission is to build a more equitable society by increasing access to justice. We're starting by helping people file small claims court cases. My cofounder and I have worked at Facebook, Instagram, and Lyft over the past 6 years and have a lot of experience on product, engineering and marketing. We're looking for someone to join who we can trust to be our customer success expert.

**Responsibilities:**
In this role, you will be responsible for all of the marketing needs of the company. We source nearly all of our customers from google adwords today - you will be responsible for maintaining existing campaigns, coming up with ideas for new campaigns, writing copy, running retargeting and prospecting ads, and expanding to new channels like bing and facebook.

You'll also be responsible for helping us win at SEO by developing content pages, figuring out new ways to get great customer reviews onto different websites to boost our pagerank, etc.

Finally, if you're really great, you can experiment with offline advertising (billboards, mailers, etc.) and referral bonuses.

Being a member of a 3 person company means that you should be the kind of person willing flex on your day to day duties to cover whatever the company needs. 

**Qualifications**
You should be someone who's run some good marketing campaigns at scale yourself, and understands how direct response / digital marketing works under the hood. This isn't the place to learn marketing, it's the place to prove how good you are at it and get a seat on a rocketship.

We don't really care about your educational credentials - as long as you can read, write, and run ads that work.

If you can also do some graphic design, that'll be helpful.

**Application Process**
Apply for this job on linkedin, send me a short message directly if you can, we'll do a 30min interview (behavior + case study). That's it.

**Compensation**
We'll figure something out. Generally won't be too much as an intern, but will be very well worth it if we convert you to full time. This is one of the rare companies where you can 1) join early (2) shape the culture and direction (3) make money doing something good for society. If you just want to maximize your compensation, you should probably go somewhere else.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2408438994?url=https%3A%2F%2Fad%2Edoubleclick%2Enet%2Fddm%2Fclk%2F454929249%3B272105847%3Bt%3Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fcareers%2Ealdi%2Eus%2Fjob%2F-%2F-%2F61%2F18676190%3Futm_source%3Dlinkedin%2Ecom%26utm_campaign%3Dbrand%26utm_medium%3Djob_posting%26utm_content%3Dsocial_media%26ss%3Dpaid&urlHash=xEAM&refId=5ece5a6d-b85e-49ea-ba59-35bbde5319be&trackingId=zWpP4GcAqMSCUSCHs3QqRA%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite

Summer 2021 Internship: Motley Fool Foundation - Marketing and Communications,The Motley Fool,"San Francisco, CA","Description

Who are we?

We are The Motley Fool, a purpose-driven financial services firm with nearly 30 years of expertise. Our goal is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer by providing outstanding business and investing advice, at scale. But what does that even mean?! It means we’re helping Fools (always with a capital “F”) demystify the world of finance, beat the stock market, and achieve personal wealth and happiness through our investing services, like Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Wealth Management, our portfolio management service.

What does this team do?

The Motley Fool Foundation is a NEW public charity created in January 2020 to coordinate and expand the philanthropic (or, Foolanthropic, if you will!) goals and activities of The Motley Fool. Foolanthropy has been core to the Fool since the days of dial-up internet and boy bands with frosted tips. (That would be 1997, when we launched The Motley Fool Charity Fund, the Internet's first ever group-giving campaign!) Since then, we’ve raised millions of dollars for charity, coordinated thousands of employee volunteer hours, and pioneered Fool School, teaching personal finance and investing basics to the next generation of Fools. Now, The Motley Fool Foundation’s focus is on leveraging our access and relationships in the global investing community to unlock financial freedom for all.

What would you do in this role?

As our Marketing and Communications Intern, you will help our team develop and implement a comprehensive marcom strategy for current and future partners, donors, and stakeholders. You’ll be responsible for helping us tell our story via email, social media, website, and print. We need a strong communicator with exceptional written, verbal, and presentation skills, who can harness the irreverent and imaginative “Foolish” voice to inspire others, even when writing about serious topics like economic empowerment, systemic barriers to financial freedom, and underprivileged communities.

This is a paid, full time (40 hrs/wk) internship from June - August, 2021, that will be fully remote, although our office is just outside Washington, DC, in Alexandria, VA.

But what does this role actually do?
Assist in the creation of branding and communication strategies, including website development and email outreach campaigns, and PR/media list and outreach plan
Conduct market research (including polls, surveys, focus groups and internet stalking) about Motley Fool employees, members, Foundation stakeholders, and strategic communities.
Translate our research findings into key brand messages to be used to support the Foundation’s mission
Track the activities of “complaborators” (potential future competitors/collaborative partners) - organizations already doing great work in our areas of interest. Keep our team in the know by presenting your findings about their mission, programs, and how they communicate with and engage their supporters!
Write compelling, Foolish content for surveys, website, emails and presentations
Keep our website and social media up-to-date with relevant messaging, event information, and donation opportunities
Assist with project management to implement our research and communications strategies - scheduling meetings, tracking milestones, and doing data entry
What do you need to apply?
Creativity. Bring a lot of it, and be hands on with it.
Experience. Must have had hands-on experience (ie internship, summer work) marketing a nonprofit, a major brand, or have worked in a creative agency environment serving either.
Exceptional communications skills. Say it, Write it. Show it. Please submit a writing sample of no more than 500 words about what financial freedom means to you.
You have in-depth knowledge and passion for current trends in digital marketing, brand, brand strategy, and communications and have completed coursework or possess direct, relevant experience.
Be heart-driven, positive, collaborative, fun, and kind – and want to be part of a team and network that feels the same!
It’s even better if you…
Love, and excel at, building processes from the ground up. Attention to detail, strategic thinking, and strong organizational and interpersonal skills are essential.
Feel comfortable working in an entrepreneurial environment where not all of the questions have been answered. You should bring a fine-tuned sense of when to take initiative and work independently, and when to ask for help.
Have a can-do attitude, the ability to improvise and implement solutions, and stellar follow-up and follow-through skills. You’ll be working on a small team making a big difference in the world.
Are excited about helping us build tools and programs to make the world smarter, happier, and richer. Show us your passionate commitment to equity and economic justice!
Please submit a short writing sample (500 words or less), along with any other samples of your creative work, along with your resume and cover letter detailing how your passions and prior experiences make you a great fit!

The Motley Fool is firmly committed to diversity, inclusion, and equity. We are a motley group of overachievers that have built a culture of trust founded on Foolishness, fun, and a commitment to making the world smarter, happier and richer. However you identify or whatever winding road has led you to us, please don't hesitate to apply if the description above leaves you thinking, ""Hey! I could do that!""",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2438555370?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Ejobvite%2Ecom%2Fthemotleyfool%2Fjob%2FouLtefwG%3F__jvst%3DJob%2BBoard%26__jvsd%3DLinkedIn&urlHash=Muo_&refId=f5ffebae-6400-4c40-99e1-4072ebd85c37&trackingId=9nwwisDd%2FdjKtVku1Bnfrg%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite
Marketing Internship 2021,Understory,"Remote, OR","About Understory

Climate change is creating a crisis for the insurance industry and those who rely on it for financial security.
Every year, severe weather causes billions of dollars of damage. Yet traditional insurers lack the tools to accurately assess and price severe weather risk. Without knowing what to expect, insurers expect the worst, leading to unaffordable premiums. For industries such as retail automotive and agriculture, traditional insurance is becoming unattainable. These business owners are at risk of financial devastation whenever a storm strikes.
Understory is the first company to solve the insurance coverage crisis with data-driven insurance for severe weather, starting with hail. Our growing network of ground-based Dot weather sensors, combined with our Atmospheric Intelligence AI, allow us to assess and price any weather risk in the world.
When severe weather strikes, Understory detects it and triggers a fast, predetermined payout. There are no burdensome financial deductibles, and no lengthy claims process. Ultimately, Understory allows capital to quickly flow where it's needed most after a disaster, protecting everything from automobiles to the world's food supply.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity.

The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs.

So why should you work with us?

Heat Makes Sense, Inc. is a fast-growing hair care/tool manufacturer based out of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that’s been providing fun, performance-driven products and tools to professional stylists and consumers since 2009. Our products are carried by salon professionals and retailers worldwide. You’ve seen amika in Birchbox, Sephora and in your high-end salon (check amika out: loveamika.com) and you’ve seen Eva-NYC in Costco, Target and Urban Outfitters (check eva out: eva-nyc.com). We know we owe a lot of our success to our office culture and embracing a family-like work environment.

Unlike most other companies, we create everything in-house. Our product development team takes an idea for a tool or shampoo and tests a bunch of different versions (employee participation encouraged!). Next, it goes to our design team to create our unique packaging and marketing materials and then on to operations to get produced. From there, marketing, sales and ecommerce take the reins to get it out into the world. All along the way, we have our executives, accounting and HR/Admin departments to make sure the company itself is running smoothly (we still have hiccups but we’re getting there!) No matter what part of the company you work, you have an impact on the company as a whole, which inspires a team mentality.

“Work hard play hard” may be cliché but it’s really what we believe in. We have company events throughout the year, big and small: from going to the bar for happy hour to a field trip to Coney Island (we love our home of Brooklyn). We have an amazing rooftop where we BBQ during the summer and we have a Summer Friday event calendar.

Here are some quotes from real employees to tell you about who we are:
“Great products, great ideas, fun environment, great employees, capable and caring management, and endless opportunities for growth and development.”
“A warm and encouraging atmosphere.”
“Relationships between co-workers are extremely important here, which makes the overall experience of going to work very pleasant.”
“Hard work is recognized.”
“I feel lucky to be a part of a brand that is on an upward path—it is a very exciting time.”
“Lots of fun events where you spend time and get to know coworkers outside the office, overall my team felt like a family, and that’s rare in the workplace.”
“Super supportive management that really lets you have a voice and listens to your input and ideas.”
“What I like most about the company is the encouragements to grow your career. All of the brand presidents and most other people in leadership roles were here from the beginning and moved up to where they are now. Its inspiring and exciting - the company is truly serious about empowering and elevating people’s careers.”

I highly recommend taking this internship whether it’s for-credit or just to get some experience under your belt--you won’t regret it!” -Bridget Neirotti (Fall 2018) (Bucks County Community College)

“My experience at L&H Bridal was nothing but rewarding. I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to intern at such a lovely, family owned boutique. During my internship my main job was to run all L&H bridal, boutique, and RACK’s social media pages, but I also worked on some long-term projects on top of that. I was able to add a car magnet, window decal, advertising banners, snap chat filters and so much more to my portfolio after my summer with L&H. I would defiantly recommend this internship for anyone who is majoring in Fashion merchandising, media, or marketing!” -Victoria Carney (Summer 2018) (Kent State University)

We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual's needs, beliefs, behaviors and aspirations. And we commit to doing this in every aspect of our work for clients and their consumers.

We actively foster an inclusive workplace where diversity and individual difference are valued and leveraged to achieve the agency's vision. And most importantly we value every individual's wellbeing.

We are Fiercely Individual.

We're committed to racial justice, equality, representation and unbiased economic opportunity, because we know that the strength of our diversity helps us create our best work.

Marketing Intern,Fifth Wall,"New York, NY","VTS is changing the way that commercial real estate (CRE) is done-disrupting a $15 trillion industry by becoming the modern operating system for CRE. We invented the category of leasing and asset management, which allows landlords and brokers to take their entire leasing process online to maximize revenue and performance. Last year, we launched the fastest adopted new product in proptech, VTS Market. We recently launched VTS Data, already getting front-page references in the Wall Street Journal and quoted by Reuters, The Real Deal, Commerical Observer, and many more. Our success shows in our numbers-we hit ""Unicorn"" status in 2019 and today we have over 12 billion square feet of commercial space managed on VTS Lease (that's the equivalent of 5,500 buildings the size of the World Trade Center) in 34 countries, and we've expanded to over 350 employees globally. It's an exciting time to join the VTS team as we continue to grow rapidly.
Our headquarters are in NYC, but we have hubs in other major US cities, Toronto, CA, and London, UK.

Summer 2021 Internship: Motley Fool Foundation - Marketing and Communications,The Motley Fool,"Philadelphia, PA","Description

Who are we?

We are The Motley Fool, a purpose-driven financial services firm with nearly 30 years of expertise. Our goal is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer by providing outstanding business and investing advice, at scale. But what does that even mean?! It means we’re helping Fools (always with a capital “F”) demystify the world of finance, beat the stock market, and achieve personal wealth and happiness through our investing services, like Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Wealth Management, our portfolio management service.

What does this team do?

The Motley Fool Foundation is a NEW public charity created in January 2020 to coordinate and expand the philanthropic (or, Foolanthropic, if you will!) goals and activities of The Motley Fool. Foolanthropy has been core to the Fool since the days of dial-up internet and boy bands with frosted tips. (That would be 1997, when we launched The Motley Fool Charity Fund, the Internet's first ever group-giving campaign!) Since then, we’ve raised millions of dollars for charity, coordinated thousands of employee volunteer hours, and pioneered Fool School, teaching personal finance and investing basics to the next generation of Fools. Now, The Motley Fool Foundation’s focus is on leveraging our access and relationships in the global investing community to unlock financial freedom for all.

What would you do in this role?

As our Marketing and Communications Intern, you will help our team develop and implement a comprehensive marcom strategy for current and future partners, donors, and stakeholders. You’ll be responsible for helping us tell our story via email, social media, website, and print. We need a strong communicator with exceptional written, verbal, and presentation skills, who can harness the irreverent and imaginative “Foolish” voice to inspire others, even when writing about serious topics like economic empowerment, systemic barriers to financial freedom, and underprivileged communities.

This is a paid, full time (40 hrs/wk) internship from June - August, 2021, that will be fully remote, although our office is just outside Washington, DC, in Alexandria, VA.

But what does this role actually do?
Assist in the creation of branding and communication strategies, including website development and email outreach campaigns, and PR/media list and outreach plan
Conduct market research (including polls, surveys, focus groups and internet stalking) about Motley Fool employees, members, Foundation stakeholders, and strategic communities.
Translate our research findings into key brand messages to be used to support the Foundation’s mission
Track the activities of “complaborators” (potential future competitors/collaborative partners) - organizations already doing great work in our areas of interest. Keep our team in the know by presenting your findings about their mission, programs, and how they communicate with and engage their supporters!
Write compelling, Foolish content for surveys, website, emails and presentations
Keep our website and social media up-to-date with relevant messaging, event information, and donation opportunities
Assist with project management to implement our research and communications strategies - scheduling meetings, tracking milestones, and doing data entry
What do you need to apply?
Creativity. Bring a lot of it, and be hands on with it.

Digital Marketing Intern,PathMatch,Los Angeles Metropolitan Area,"Are you a student in the Classes of 2021-2025 interested in a career in Digital Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing.

Most students don’t realize how critical internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing skills in a classroom because most universities don’t offer Digital Marketing classes. And, you certainly won’t learn the strategies, processes, and technologies companies use unless you work within an internship.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where the first six weeks, students learn the fundamentals of digital marketing. In the second 6 weeks, you’ll be matched to a company where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Six weeks of curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement for six weeks with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.
