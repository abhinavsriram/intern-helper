MBA Investment Consulting Internship,"NEPC, LLC","Boston, MA","Job Summary: 
We are seeking five summer interns in our Boston office (or virtually) who are currently pursuing their MBA or Master’s degree preferably in Finance or Economics. Projects assignments are available in our Healthcare Consulting, Endowments & Foundations Consulting, and Investment Research areas. One of the Research Projects on our Portfolio Construction Team requires use of the programming language R. These internships are specifically designed to welcome candidates with diverse backgrounds into NEPC for a summer experience. Interns will work on projects that will contribute to the success of NEPC while learning about the Investment Consulting industry and investment management.  
Upon successful completion of the internship, interns may be invited back to participate in a Sr. Investment Associate Rotational Program lasting up to 2 years (4 rotations) post-graduation. This is a new program that NEPC has designed specifically to attract diverse candidates and give them broad exposure to different areas of the firm. Associates will cycle through different departments to gain exposure and experience. Successful Sr. Investment Associates will be placed in a permanent assignment within the firm over a 12-24-month cycle.

Job Requirements:
We are seeking candidates who have already had some exposure to the investment industry either through a permanent position or prior internship. The ideal candidate should have a strong analytical skillset, excellent written and verbal communication skills and a working knowledge of Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint), close attention to detail and a willingness to learn. The candidate should be working toward an MBA or Master’s degree ideally majoring in Finance or Economics.

Project Summaries:
NEPC’s Diverse Manager Research Project:
This intern will assist in the refinement of methodology and the scoring rubric to help NEPC rate asset management firms on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). This is an important initiative for NEPC as we are fully committed as a firm to offering Diverse Managers to our clients as an integral part of their portfolio. This project will involve understanding and assessment of the existing tool in order to suggest appropriate changes. The project will result in document recommendations for how to integrate the DEI Score with NEPC manager research process and how to train other analysts to use the DEI Score. For this project, experience in survey design, DEI and analysis of asset management firms is preferred. The intern will have the opportunity to work with NEPC’s Diverse Manager Committee on this project. The Committee is made up of members of our various consulting practice areas as well as members of our Research team. The project will provide broad exposure to the inner workings of NEPC’s research and manager assessment process. This project will result in the implementation of the DEI Score as part of the assessment process by working with the DMC and a research analyst to rate the first set of asset managers. This intern will gain hands-on experience applying a quantitative measure to assess a qualitative factor (progress toward Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) in the manager research process.

Portfolio Construction Privat Equity Pacing Project: NEPC’s Portfolio Construction team is seeking a summer intern to integrate its private equity pacing model into something more user friendly and accessible for consultants and clients using the programming language R. These pacing models develop performance and cash flow assumptions for portfolio commitments, both for existing investment commitments and those anticipated in the future. NEPC’s portfolio construction team works with NEPC’s clients to solve portfolio construction and asset class implementation challenges. The team works across NEPC research to incorporate the Firm’s best ideas in public and private markets. The Portfolio Construction Team works in tandem with clients to analyze their exposures through a quantitative and qualitative lens that is specific to the portfolio goals and objectives of each client. This is an important project because two thirds of clients have an annual or semi-annual pacing model. Creating a tool to simplify this process would be extremely valuable. This assignment will allow the intern to practice a coding language, build a tool with high impact across the firm and give them the opportunity to learn how private equity works and how clients use the different areas of private equity to meet their investment objectives. 

NEPC Manager Data Research Project: Reporting into the Director of Public Markets, this summer internship will involve work resulting in more efficient and effective management and communication of data sharing on a large universe of investment managers. The project will include:
(1) Surveying consultants to determine the most important/critical manager data.
(2) Determine how to access that data.
(3) Develop a process for loading and sharing data.
(4) Develop analytics to use data. (This project will also include capture and analysis of preferential NEPC fees for clients.)
Strong communication, project management, and process planning skills are necessary to be successful in this project. Reasonable systems and data skills needed but programming skills not required. Successful completion of this project provided the potential to get better, real time data into consultants' hands and the ability to communicate clients fee savings aggregated across entire portfolio. The intern will learn and develop specific skills such as communication and collaboration across teams, project planning and the ability to see business level impact of major project. This intern can exhibit skills that could be used in a full-time manager research or research operations role.

Endowment and Foundation Team Global Trends Project: NEPC’s E&F Team is seeking an intern who would be focused on gathering research about the changing preferences of E&Fs globally. We believe that some of the trends with momentum (DEI, Impact, Innovation, Collaboration) align with the strengths of NEPC. This intern will seek out recent studies, gather industry data, and summarize high profile efforts of well-known E&Fs. This intern will also explore the global market to provide insights on the nuances of serving global E&Fs as well as the appropriate preferable locations, target size, pricing etc. It is likely that this project would culminate in developing some content (email, webinar, etc.) applicable to reach out to high potential prospects.
Organizational skills, time management, communication (written and verbal) and ability to conduct research independently are important for this intern to be successful. The individual should be comfortable conducting market study-type research. An interest or prior experience/exposure to DEI, Impact Investing, and/or Endowments & Foundations would be helpful.
This project can have a big impact on helping the E&F team to refine our messaging in the market. This project will help NEPC link to specific industry trends, highlight our capabilities in relation to those trends, and seek out potential prospects for some targeted marketing. Add in the layer of looking globally, and this potentially opens a strong proactive pipeline for the E&F team to build on in the next 12-36 months. As this project has multiple perspectives – from marketing/strategy to research areas of focus – this individual will learn about the various angles of the investment consulting industry, not exclusively about E&Fs.

Healthcare Consulting Team New Business Marketing Project:  NEPC’s Healthcare Consulting team has been growing at a very fast-pace and is considered an industry leader.  Consolidation among both Healthcare organizations and competitor consulting firms has allowed NEPC to continue to evolve the strength of its brand and grow market share. The summer intern will have the opportunity to work closely with a Partner on the Healthcare team to shape and revamp new business presentations for the practice. This project will involve assessing the current new business pitch book, determining areas of improvement and revisions, and then developing and creating a new and improved template for the Healthcare Team. The intern will develop a project plan and approach in the first few weeks and then spend the summer gathering appropriate data and input, making recommendations and creating materials. The intern must have strong inter-personal skills, be a self-starter and preferably have some prior experience or exposure to marketing and sales in the financial services industry. starter. This project could have a strong impact on future new business opportunities and help NEPC to win more clients in the future. This individual will have the opportunity to learn about the investment consulting sales process as well as working with others; being able to pull together different points of view. There may also be the potential to attend a new business presentation.
