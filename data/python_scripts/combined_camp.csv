Campaign Intern: Right to Repair (FALL),U.S. PIRG,"Boston, MA","Company Description

U.S. PIRG is an advocate for the public interest, working to win concrete results on real problems that affect millions of lives, and standing up for the public against powerful interests when they push the other way.

The problems we face don’t care if you’re a liberal or a conservative, or if you live in a red or blue state — they affect each and every one of us. That’s why, for decades, we’ve taken a non-partisan, fact-driven, results-oriented approach to our work. And with your help, we can take on the difficult challenges ahead.

Job Description

We think you should be able to fix your stuff.

We generate way too much waste, and companies use their power in the marketplace to make things harder to repair. Some companies design products to be impossible to repair -- such as gluing the battery in a smartphone so it cannot be replaced -- or making repair proprietary so that only the manufacturing company can do the repairs.

We should give every consumer and every small business access to the parts, tools, and service information they need to repair products so we can keep things in use and reduce waste.

Join with the Public Interest Network’s Right to Repair campaign, working to pass legislation to reduce waste and increase repairs. Help us stand up to tech giants who would prefer we just throw it out and not repair it, as we coordinate our affiliates in a number of target states to pass legislation.

Get hands-on experience meeting with legislators, building coalitions and working with the media. Working directly with the Campaign Director, your internship will involve:
• Writing: Create and distribute media materials, including blog entries, press releases, press advisories, letters-to-the-editor, and issue fact sheets.
• Media Outreach: Organize press conferences, coordinate social media program, call reporters, and maintain a good working relationship with elected officials, issue experts and coalition partners.
• Public Official Outreach: Help us build support from local elected officials by communicating our message to their offices.
• Social Media: Help us design materials, shareable images and social media content, for coordinated distribution by our campaign team

Qualifications

Graduated or enrolled in a bachelor’s or associate's degree program in communications, journalism, political science, public relations or a closely related field preferred, but not required.

Additional Information

All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.
