Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

For every hour doctors spend with their patients, they spend two hours on process and clerical tasks. And when they do meet with patients, they spend most of the time glued to their computer taking notes and entering orders. Not only does this lead to doctor burnout, but it can also be extremely distracting for patients, especially in current times where increasing levels of doctor-patient interaction is taking place online. We are EmpowerMD, a multi-disciplinary team of scientists, engineers, designers, and medical experts in Microsoft Healthcare building ambient intelligence for the clinic using machine learning and AI. This will let doctors focus on what they do best: taking care of patients.
