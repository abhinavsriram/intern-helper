Responsibilities

Who you are.

• You have outstanding problem solving and analytical skills
• You are a good communicator (written and verbal)
• You are enthusiastic about working in a team, and have great people skills
• A passion for learning technologies and applying them to the right projects will make you successful in this position.

In a typical week you may:
• Build features used by hundreds-of-thousands of people around the world
• Write code on a modern software stack (Java and AngularJS are the main flavors of the day, but we also use Scala, CQL for Cassandra, and other modern technologies)

Our Java/Scala/Kotlin-based REST API is built on Spring Boot and Hibernate which serves traffic to both web and mobile consumers. We’re using a combination of Mongo, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra and Redis. Redis, specifically, is used extensively in a distributed locking system, responsible for supporting real-time data processing. All of this uses Amazon Web Services extensively for stability and high availability.

We practice Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery using TeamCity; as a result we have continual smaller releases to our environments (Development, QA, Staging, Production), with integrated unit tests and code coverage analysis while eliminating the risk taken on with only a few large releases/product updates.

• Exposure to continuous integration and/or continuous deployment and automated testing
• Familiarity with webpack and JavaScript build tools

Security Competencies:
