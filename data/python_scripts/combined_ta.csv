DEEP COLLABORATION, CONSTANT EVOLUTION

Collaboration here isn't a buzzword: it's woven into everything we do. Teams of English and Spanish or Chinese teachers share two classes of students, collaborating to nurture their students' social, emotional and academic growth. Teacher teams share responsibility for the curriculum and plan together daily. This intense collaboration is challenging as well as exciting: we're always evolving, learning from each other and seeking to improve.

LANGUAGE IMMERSION

Avenues students will graduate fluent in a second language and at ease beyond their borders. To this end, in the younger grades, students alternate days between English and Spanish or Chinese classrooms.

In addition to their classroom work, interns will participate in weekly intern meetings where they explore issues essential to elementary education and discuss how these issues are playing out in our classrooms. These meetings also offer interns the opportunity to share and reflect upon their experiences, thereby gaining new perspective. Each intern will leave with a portfolio of work that serves as a resource in his/her career, as well as a certificate of completion. In your role, you will:
