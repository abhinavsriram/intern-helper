ERM and Regulatory Compliance

ERM

Enterprise risk management (ERM) is the Bank’s enterprise risk competence—the ability to understand, control, and articulate the nature and level of risks taken in pursuit of business strategies—coupled with accountability for risks taken and activities engaged in. One of the main benefits of ERM is an enhanced perspective and focus on risk management across the institution. The changing regulatory environment, economic turmoil, and growing complexity of products, tools, and risks has, among other influences, helped to launch the practice of enterprise risk management into the financial services area. By definition, the business of banking exposes the organization to a wide variety of risks. The ERM framework is designed to support the depth and breadth of activities by providing a structured approach for identifying, measuring, controlling, and reporting on the significant risks faced by an organization. Specific risk management (e.g., credit, operational, market), capital management, and liquidity management provide the essential underpinnings to an ERM framework. ERM is the governance structure that provides the horizontal view of the risk disciplines and operational risks of an institution.

Regulatory Compliance

Various consumer protection, fair lending, fair housing, and community reinvestment laws apply to financial institutions’ interactions with customers and communities. The Regulatory Compliance Department is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s compliance with all applicable laws and regulations established by Congress and the federal and state regulatory agencies, including the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Regulations, Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2344702600?url=https%3A%2F%2Frecruiting%2Eultipro%2Ecom%2FPEA1006PEAA%2FJobBoard%2Fc36308a9-3cc9-405a-a034-40797ac7607e%2F%2FOpportunityDetail%3FopportunityId%3D66b269cc-fe13-4ee8-8f60-b7890bae0097%26utm_source%3DLINKEDIN%26utm_medium%3Dreferrer&urlHash=0OPl&refId=ccac3793-8427-4fee-ba88-d131a675c541&trackingId=urj1uJ4mno%2FKuk6w00B93A%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite
