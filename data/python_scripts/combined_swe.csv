Research and development of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) software and hardware tools; develop an AR/VR solution to simulate real-world environments and facilitate activities such as remote maintenance of complex systems and virtual training environments.

Interns will spend the majority of their time researching, installing, and configuring new tools, programming using the selected tools, and learning more efficient methods to solve a given problem. Interns are not required to be programming experts, but they should have a passion for learning new things and not be afraid to jump in and try out new tools and/or solutions.

Interns will leverage an Agile Development process with daily scrum meetings facilitated using Jira to capture user stories and track the status of all issues. Fridays are reserved for documenting the work each week in the form of a Wiki site, as well as numerous forms of documentation (PowerPoint, Word, Visio, etc.).
