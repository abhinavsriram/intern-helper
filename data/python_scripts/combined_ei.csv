Position Description The rich history of African American people, cultures, and communities in Essex County,Massachusetts runs deep. This history is embedded in the cultural landscape, fromcemeteries to a renamed park in honor of two famed 19th century black abolitionists. EssexCounty residents, archivists, educators, interpreters, historians, and scholars alike have beenworking to unearth this history and recover these fascinating stories in order to provide afuller account of the county's past and present. In a span of nearly four hundred years, Blackpeople have shaped and been shaped by Essex County. However, real challenges, historicand contemporary, have thwarted the efforts of even the most enterprising and well-trainedexperts because much of this history is hidden, scattered or misplaced. And therein lies theopportunity and need that must be met. Because this history is hidden, residents andtourists alike fail to appreciate the fundamental role African Americans have played in thehistory of Essex County. In 2020, the two-year, grant-funded report, The African AmericanExperience in Essex County, Massachusetts: An Annotated Guide, was completed. Thepurpose of the report is to identify, locate, and compile the collections and resources,organizations, and individuals concerning the Black experience in Essex County. Our twoNational Park Service units in Essex County have sought to implement an inclusive,audience-centered interpretative approach that more prominently features the stories ofAfrican Americans. The report synthesizes key themes and offers suggestions for projectsand serves as a basis for developing historically sound, inclusive programming, fromexhibitions to school projects. African Americans and people of African descent stand tall inEssex County's past, present, and future. There are a wide range of stories and accounts ofBlack women in these collections and repositories. However, there is no singular ""Blackwoman's” story to be told. The intern would work within a theme of the diverse ways inwhich Black women built lives, careers, and families, as well as fought for change, survivedand resisted oppression, and spoke out boldly for themselves and others. The intern willresearch African American women of Essex County who operated within and outside ofsystems that were intended to reduce or limit them; Black women who were leaders ineducation, in business, in civic life, in family life, in activism. The research will focus on boththe names that are well-known and the countless women whose names history hasforgotten, but who nevertheless built and fueled the culture of Essex County for generations.In the ""Recommendations” section of the report, these are a few of the women suggested tobe researched: Charlotte Forten (Salem State University), Rose Lovejoy (Andover), FrancesCole Lee (Haverhill Public Library), Myrna Mitchell Brown (Lawrence), Sarah Remond (PhillipsLibrary), Juno Larcom (Historic Beverly), Agnes (Marblehead), and Sara Baro Colcher(Topsfield). While there are few complete collections of Black women's archival materials,African American women are not completely absent in the historical records. An exhibitcould make this explicit. Suggested ways an intern could tell the stories of the hundreds ofBlack women who have lived in Essex County who did not leave behind personal materials inthe archives include:
Using names from Massachusetts Vital Records and selecting somefrom Essex County to trace through Marriage, Births, and Deaths;
telling the story of Blackwomen who had accounts at the Salem Savings Bank using the records available throughthe Salem State University Archives; and
giving voice to the stories of Black women who were incarcerated at Essex County Jail. The intern will be responsible for researching,planning, drafting, and proposing an exhibit for the Salem Armory Visitor Center that couldalso travel to historic sites and museums in Essex County. Qualifications The intern should ideally be working toward a graduate degree in history or a related field, and have course work, experience, or interest in African American history, public history, education, and/or interpretation. The intern must have strong oral and written communication skills and some experience in working in the archives and/or at museum/historic site settings. The intern should be able to work independently 75% of the time. The intern should be someone who has experience and/or interest in developing an inclusive, audience-centered approach to education and interpretation that more prominently features and centers the stories of African American women.

Background

The ‘Education Plus’ initiative is a new, high-profile initiative to accelerate actions and investments to halt and reverse the disproportionate burden due to HIV borne by adolescent girls and young women. It is centered on the empowerment of adolescent girls and young women and the achievement of gender equality in sub-Saharan Africa - with secondary education as the strategic entry point. The initiative is co-led by UNAIDS, UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA and UNESCO and is focused on driving country-level impact, with champion governments and supported by a wide network of regional bodies and global coalitions and partners.

It responds to the urgent need to effectively address the alarming numbers of adolescent girls and young women acquiring HIV and dying of AIDS, among other threats to their survival, well-being, human rights and fundamental freedoms. It brings added pressure to persuade governments to roll out universal secondary education, free for girls and boys, and scale up multi-sectoral policies, actions and investments that empower adolescent girls and young women.

Education

The ‘Education Plus’ approach is centered on the essential elements of empowerment that every adolescent girl and young woman should be entitled to in their transitions to adulthood
Completion of quality secondary education
Universal access to comprehensive sexuality education
Fulfillment of sexual and reproductive health and rights
Freedom from gender-based and sexual violence
Successful school-to-work transitions and young women’s economic empowerment

UNICEF leads the pillar on engagement and participation of adolescent girls and young women through a Nerve Center consisting of young leaders recruited across East and Southern Africa and West and Central Africa.

The Primary School is expanding the boundaries of traditional education.

We start early. We start working with parents and enroll children into our program as early as 12 months to reach them at their most critical stage in development.
We work with - not around - families. We know that parents and caregivers are the most important people in a child's life. We partner with them to enhance the education and health of their children.
We integrate multiple systems to serve the whole child. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.

In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four-year-olds. We have grown to serve over 300 children and their families via a 0-3 parent/child program, a preschool and elementary school, and a parent wellness program.

Our ultimate goal is to create a game-changing system of care for children that can be replicated across the country. To that end, we are building a model that can be effectively implemented in diverse communities and sustained on public funding. In 2020 we expanded our student and family population in East Palo Alto and opened our next site in Hayward, California. In 2021, we will be piloting our Bridge to Preschool program in San Francisco for the first time. It's an exciting time to join the team!
