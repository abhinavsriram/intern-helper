Summer 2021 Internship: Motley Fool Foundation - Programming and Board Relations,The Motley Fool,"Charlotte, NC","Description

Who are we?

We are The Motley Fool, a purpose-driven financial services firm with nearly 30 years of expertise. Our goal is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer by providing outstanding business and investing advice, at scale. But what does that even mean?! It means we’re helping Fools (always with a capital “F”) demystify the world of finance, beat the stock market, and achieve personal wealth and happiness through our investing services, like Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Wealth Management, our portfolio management service.

What does this team do?

The Motley Fool Foundation is a NEW public charity created in January 2020 to coordinate and expand the philanthropic (or, Foolanthropic, if you will!) goals and activities of The Motley Fool. Foolanthropy has been core to the Fool since the days of dial-up internet and boy bands with frosted tips. (That would be 1997, when we launched The Motley Fool Charity Fund, the Internet's first ever group-giving campaign!) Since then, we’ve raised millions of dollars for charity, coordinated thousands of employee volunteer hours, and pioneered Fool School, teaching personal finance and investing basics to the next generation of Fools. Now, The Motley Fool Foundation’s focus is on leveraging our access and relationships in the global investing community to unlock financial freedom for all.

What would you do in this role?

As our Programming and Board Relations Intern, you will have a front-row seat as we outline and implement programs that directly affect the people we serve. You will help us develop our first pilot programs, and collect, organize, and summarize feedback and suggestions from all of our stakeholders. You will also play a valuable role supporting the work of our Board, implementing leading-edge organizational governance processes, and facilitating Board member participation in influence strategies, external communications, and fundraising efforts.

This is a paid, full time (40 hrs/wk) internship from June - August, 2021, that will be fully remote, although our office is just outside Washington, DC, in Alexandria, VA.

But what does this role actually do?
Delve into the world of financial empowerment to uncover best practices and areas of opportunity for the Foundation’s programs and impact
Identify and develop relationships for prospective strategic partnerships, including corporations, foundations, and individuals
Provide dynamic support for all Board of Director activities, including managing communication and planning and executing Board meetings
Assist with project management to implement our programming and partnership strategies - scheduling meetings, tracking milestones, and doing data entry
What do you need to apply?
On the ground experience with volunteer organizing and direct service programs
Interest in a broad set of progressive policy issues (entrepreneurs, women in finance, economic empowerment)
Process-oriented, attentive to detail, highly organized and skilled at juggling numerous stakeholders and priorities simultaneously
Familiarity with Office, Google Drive and Salesforce preferred
Ability to collaborate with co-workers across positions on multiple projects
Completed coursework or relevant experience in non-profit management or a related field
Be heart-driven, positive, collaborative, fun, and kind – and want to be part of a team and network that feels the same!
It’s even better if you…
Love, and excel at, building processes from the ground up. Attention to detail, strategic thinking, and strong organizational and interpersonal skills are essential.
Feel comfortable working in an entrepreneurial environment where not all of the questions have been answered. You should bring a fine-tuned sense of when to take initiative and work independently, and when to ask for help.
Have a can-do attitude, the ability to improvise and implement solutions, and stellar follow-up and follow-through skills. You’ll be working on a small team making a big difference in the world.
Are excited about helping us build tools and programs to make the world smarter, happier, and richer. Show us your passionate commitment to equity and economic justice!
Please submit a resume and cover letter detailing how your passions and prior experiences make you a great fit!

The Motley Fool is firmly committed to diversity, inclusion, and equity. We are a motley group of overachievers that have built a culture of trust founded on Foolishness, fun, and a commitment to making the world smarter, happier and richer. However you identify or whatever winding road has led you to us, please don't hesitate to apply if the description above leaves you thinking, ""Hey! I could do that!""",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2438552835?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Ejobvite%2Ecom%2Fthemotleyfool%2Fjob%2FokKtefwv%3F__jvst%3DJob%2BBoard%26__jvsd%3DLinkedIn&urlHash=-gg2&refId=8f11518f-2f8d-4e3b-b50c-b221d3dbd6fe&trackingId=HXDOx%2FQvXrWY9YkWNgApgg%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite

Summer 2021 Internship: Motley Fool Foundation - Programming and Board Relations,The Motley Fool,"Pittsburgh, PA","Description

Who are we?

We are The Motley Fool, a purpose-driven financial services firm with nearly 30 years of expertise. Our goal is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer by providing outstanding business and investing advice, at scale. But what does that even mean?! It means we’re helping Fools (always with a capital “F”) demystify the world of finance, beat the stock market, and achieve personal wealth and happiness through our investing services, like Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Wealth Management, our portfolio management service.

What does this team do?

The Motley Fool Foundation is a NEW public charity created in January 2020 to coordinate and expand the philanthropic (or, Foolanthropic, if you will!) goals and activities of The Motley Fool. Foolanthropy has been core to the Fool since the days of dial-up internet and boy bands with frosted tips. (That would be 1997, when we launched The Motley Fool Charity Fund, the Internet's first ever group-giving campaign!) Since then, we’ve raised millions of dollars for charity, coordinated thousands of employee volunteer hours, and pioneered Fool School, teaching personal finance and investing basics to the next generation of Fools. Now, The Motley Fool Foundation’s focus is on leveraging our access and relationships in the global investing community to unlock financial freedom for all.

What would you do in this role?

As our Programming and Board Relations Intern, you will have a front-row seat as we outline and implement programs that directly affect the people we serve. You will help us develop our first pilot programs, and collect, organize, and summarize feedback and suggestions from all of our stakeholders. You will also play a valuable role supporting the work of our Board, implementing leading-edge organizational governance processes, and facilitating Board member participation in influence strategies, external communications, and fundraising efforts.

This is a paid, full time (40 hrs/wk) internship from June - August, 2021, that will be fully remote, although our office is just outside Washington, DC, in Alexandria, VA.

But what does this role actually do?
Delve into the world of financial empowerment to uncover best practices and areas of opportunity for the Foundation’s programs and impact
Identify and develop relationships for prospective strategic partnerships, including corporations, foundations, and individuals
Provide dynamic support for all Board of Director activities, including managing communication and planning and executing Board meetings
Assist with project management to implement our programming and partnership strategies - scheduling meetings, tracking milestones, and doing data entry
What do you need to apply?
On the ground experience with volunteer organizing and direct service programs
Interest in a broad set of progressive policy issues (entrepreneurs, women in finance, economic empowerment)
Process-oriented, attentive to detail, highly organized and skilled at juggling numerous stakeholders and priorities simultaneously
Familiarity with Office, Google Drive and Salesforce preferred
Ability to collaborate with co-workers across positions on multiple projects
Completed coursework or relevant experience in non-profit management or a related field
Be heart-driven, positive, collaborative, fun, and kind – and want to be part of a team and network that feels the same!
It’s even better if you…
Love, and excel at, building processes from the ground up. Attention to detail, strategic thinking, and strong organizational and interpersonal skills are essential.
Feel comfortable working in an entrepreneurial environment where not all of the questions have been answered. You should bring a fine-tuned sense of when to take initiative and work independently, and when to ask for help.
Have a can-do attitude, the ability to improvise and implement solutions, and stellar follow-up and follow-through skills. You’ll be working on a small team making a big difference in the world.
Are excited about helping us build tools and programs to make the world smarter, happier, and richer. Show us your passionate commitment to equity and economic justice!
Please submit a resume and cover letter detailing how your passions and prior experiences make you a great fit!

The Motley Fool is firmly committed to diversity, inclusion, and equity. We are a motley group of overachievers that have built a culture of trust founded on Foolishness, fun, and a commitment to making the world smarter, happier and richer. However you identify or whatever winding road has led you to us, please don't hesitate to apply if the description above leaves you thinking, ""Hey!

Summer 2021 Internship: Motley Fool Foundation - Programming and Board Relations,The Motley Fool,"Los Angeles, CA","Description

Who are we?

We are The Motley Fool, a purpose-driven financial services firm with nearly 30 years of expertise. Our goal is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer by providing outstanding business and investing advice, at scale. But what does that even mean?! It means we’re helping Fools (always with a capital “F”) demystify the world of finance, beat the stock market, and achieve personal wealth and happiness through our investing services, like Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Wealth Management, our portfolio management service.

What does this team do?

The Motley Fool Foundation is a NEW public charity created in January 2020 to coordinate and expand the philanthropic (or, Foolanthropic, if you will!) goals and activities of The Motley Fool. Foolanthropy has been core to the Fool since the days of dial-up internet and boy bands with frosted tips. (That would be 1997, when we launched The Motley Fool Charity Fund, the Internet's first ever group-giving campaign!) Since then, we’ve raised millions of dollars for charity, coordinated thousands of employee volunteer hours, and pioneered Fool School, teaching personal finance and investing basics to the next generation of Fools. Now, The Motley Fool Foundation’s focus is on leveraging our access and relationships in the global investing community to unlock financial freedom for all.

What would you do in this role?

As our Programming and Board Relations Intern, you will have a front-row seat as we outline and implement programs that directly affect the people we serve. You will help us develop our first pilot programs, and collect, organize, and summarize feedback and suggestions from all of our stakeholders. You will also play a valuable role supporting the work of our Board, implementing leading-edge organizational governance processes, and facilitating Board member participation in influence strategies, external communications, and fundraising efforts.

This is a paid, full time (40 hrs/wk) internship from June - August, 2021, that will be fully remote, although our office is just outside Washington, DC, in Alexandria, VA.

But what does this role actually do?
Delve into the world of financial empowerment to uncover best practices and areas of opportunity for the Foundation’s programs and impact
Identify and develop relationships for prospective strategic partnerships, including corporations, foundations, and individuals
Provide dynamic support for all Board of Director activities, including managing communication and planning and executing Board meetings
Assist with project management to implement our programming and partnership strategies - scheduling meetings, tracking milestones, and doing data entry
What do you need to apply?
On the ground experience with volunteer organizing and direct service programs
Interest in a broad set of progressive policy issues (entrepreneurs, women in finance, economic empowerment)
Process-oriented, attentive to detail, highly organized and skilled at juggling numerous stakeholders and priorities simultaneously
Familiarity with Office, Google Drive and Salesforce preferred
Ability to collaborate with co-workers across positions on multiple projects
Completed coursework or relevant experience in non-profit management or a related field
Be heart-driven, positive, collaborative, fun, and kind – and want to be part of a team and network that feels the same!
It’s even better if you…
Love, and excel at, building processes from the ground up. Attention to detail, strategic thinking, and strong organizational and interpersonal skills are essential.
Feel comfortable working in an entrepreneurial environment where not all of the questions have been answered. You should bring a fine-tuned sense of when to take initiative and work independently, and when to ask for help.
Have a can-do attitude, the ability to improvise and implement solutions, and stellar follow-up and follow-through skills. You’ll be working on a small team making a big difference in the world.
Are excited about helping us build tools and programs to make the world smarter, happier, and richer. Show us your passionate commitment to equity and economic justice!
Please submit a resume and cover letter detailing how your passions and prior experiences make you a great fit!

The Motley Fool is firmly committed to diversity, inclusion, and equity. We are a motley group of overachievers that have built a culture of trust founded on Foolishness, fun, and a commitment to making the world smarter, happier and richer. However you identify or whatever winding road has led you to us, please don't hesitate to apply if the description above leaves you thinking, ""Hey! I could do that!""",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2438549915?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Ejobvite%2Ecom%2Fthemotleyfool%2Fjob%2FokKtefwv%3F__jvst%3DJob%2BBoard%26__jvsd%3DLinkedIn&urlHash=-gg2&refId=a519f202-5e26-4058-93a6-c5f014f7cb54&trackingId=TH208lYi8jn9ST0zXTDEFQ%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite

Summer 2021 Internship: Motley Fool Foundation - Programming and Board Relations,The Motley Fool,"Houston, TX","Description

Who are we?

We are The Motley Fool, a purpose-driven financial services firm with nearly 30 years of expertise. Our goal is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer by providing outstanding business and investing advice, at scale. But what does that even mean?! It means we’re helping Fools (always with a capital “F”) demystify the world of finance, beat the stock market, and achieve personal wealth and happiness through our investing services, like Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Wealth Management, our portfolio management service.

What does this team do?

The Motley Fool Foundation is a NEW public charity created in January 2020 to coordinate and expand the philanthropic (or, Foolanthropic, if you will!) goals and activities of The Motley Fool. Foolanthropy has been core to the Fool since the days of dial-up internet and boy bands with frosted tips. (That would be 1997, when we launched The Motley Fool Charity Fund, the Internet's first ever group-giving campaign!) Since then, we’ve raised millions of dollars for charity, coordinated thousands of employee volunteer hours, and pioneered Fool School, teaching personal finance and investing basics to the next generation of Fools. Now, The Motley Fool Foundation’s focus is on leveraging our access and relationships in the global investing community to unlock financial freedom for all.

What would you do in this role?

As our Programming and Board Relations Intern, you will have a front-row seat as we outline and implement programs that directly affect the people we serve. You will help us develop our first pilot programs, and collect, organize, and summarize feedback and suggestions from all of our stakeholders. You will also play a valuable role supporting the work of our Board, implementing leading-edge organizational governance processes, and facilitating Board member participation in influence strategies, external communications, and fundraising efforts.

This is a paid, full time (40 hrs/wk) internship from June - August, 2021, that will be fully remote, although our office is just outside Washington, DC, in Alexandria, VA.

But what does this role actually do?
Delve into the world of financial empowerment to uncover best practices and areas of opportunity for the Foundation’s programs and impact
Identify and develop relationships for prospective strategic partnerships, including corporations, foundations, and individuals
Provide dynamic support for all Board of Director activities, including managing communication and planning and executing Board meetings
Assist with project management to implement our programming and partnership strategies - scheduling meetings, tracking milestones, and doing data entry
What do you need to apply?
On the ground experience with volunteer organizing and direct service programs
Interest in a broad set of progressive policy issues (entrepreneurs, women in finance, economic empowerment)
Process-oriented, attentive to detail, highly organized and skilled at juggling numerous stakeholders and priorities simultaneously
Familiarity with Office, Google Drive and Salesforce preferred
Ability to collaborate with co-workers across positions on multiple projects
Completed coursework or relevant experience in non-profit management or a related field
Be heart-driven, positive, collaborative, fun, and kind – and want to be part of a team and network that feels the same!
It’s even better if you…
Love, and excel at, building processes from the ground up. Attention to detail, strategic thinking, and strong organizational and interpersonal skills are essential.
Feel comfortable working in an entrepreneurial environment where not all of the questions have been answered. You should bring a fine-tuned sense of when to take initiative and work independently, and when to ask for help.
Have a can-do attitude, the ability to improvise and implement solutions, and stellar follow-up and follow-through skills. You’ll be working on a small team making a big difference in the world.
Are excited about helping us build tools and programs to make the world smarter, happier, and richer. Show us your passionate commitment to equity and economic justice!
Please submit a resume and cover letter detailing how your passions and prior experiences make you a great fit!

The Motley Fool is firmly committed to diversity, inclusion, and equity. We are a motley group of overachievers that have built a culture of trust founded on Foolishness, fun, and a commitment to making the world smarter, happier and richer. However you identify or whatever winding road has led you to us, please don't hesitate to apply if the description above leaves you thinking, ""Hey! I could do that!""",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2438554502?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Ejobvite%2Ecom%2Fthemotleyfool%2Fjob%2FokKtefwv%3F__jvst%3DJob%2BBoard%26__jvsd%3DLinkedIn&urlHash=-gg2&refId=69df9350-32bb-4a7e-985e-6701fd1ddc2a&trackingId=UTODhHV%2F30XvmBKe6mFdQg%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite

The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs.
