Graphic Design Internship,RISD Museum,"Providence, RI (+1 other)","The RISD Museum partners with the Studio Institute’s Arts Intern Providence Program to offer full-time summer internships.

The Arts Intern program provides exciting opportunities for college undergraduates to learn about nonprofit professions through internships at museums and other cultural institutions. The program seeks candidates with demonstrated financial need and encourages applicants from diverse cultural backgrounds.

Each intern works closely with a staff mentor on a project relevant to their areas of interest. In addition, Arts Interns must participate in the education component of the program, which is spread out across nine program days throughout the summer. These days will be used to visit other institutions in their city as a cohort, where the interns will have the opportunity to learn about other jobs in the field, and to complete program assignments.

This program is 9 weeks in length, 28 hours per week. Interns receive $15 per hour in addition to a $500 stipend for completing the Arts Intern component of the program. Visit the Program Details page for more information.

RISD Museum internships may be virtual or hybrid this summer; plans are subject to RISD's guidelines and will be communicated by the end of April to all interviewed students.
