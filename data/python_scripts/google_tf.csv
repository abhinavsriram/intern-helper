Breakthrough Teaching Fellow Intern,Breakthrough Collaborative,"Boston, MA","We will be running a virtual summer program from June 17 – August 18th where interns will have the opportunity to receive training, lead their own virtual classrooms, mentor students, and receive coaching from a professional teacher.

We are hiring fewer interns this summer and as a result will likely wrap up the hiring process earlier in the season than in previous years. (likely by late March/early April).

NOTE: SHECP Interns will be joining the Breakthrough Internship Program.

2020 timetable. (2021 will be announced when available) – The first week SHECP Interns will help Breakthrough staff prepare for arrival of more than 100 Breakthrough Teaching Fellows. Then, SHECP Interns will join as Breakthrough interns for a two-week training and orientation program beginning June 15. Students arrive June 29 for a five week program that concludes August 7. SHECP Breakthrough Interns would need to travel to Arlington, VA, on Friday, July 31 for the SHECP Closing Conference and then return to Boston on Sunday, August 2, to complete the program on August 7.

Breakthrough will cover the travel cost from Arlington back to Boston and then to the interns next destination, as well as provide a stipend for the six additional days. Interns would continue to reside at the SHECP Boston-area housing",https://www.shepherdconsortium.org/job/breakthrough-collaborative-somerville-ma-education-youth-outreach-teaching-fellow/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic
