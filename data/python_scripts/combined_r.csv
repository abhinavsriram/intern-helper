Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

Many physicists have wondered how the universe chooses its basic laws. One idea is that the laws-or the parameters that characterize them, such as the masses of the different quarks and leptons, can evolve in time. Several mechanisms have been proposed, which can be visualized as a point representing the universe moving on a vast landscape of possible laws. This turns out to be a process that can be efficiently simulated by a deep neural network. We continue our work started in 2020 building and running models to investigate this and other ideas about how the universe chose or learnt its laws.

Job Summary

Our Focus
Founded in 2015, The University of Chicago Inclusive Economy Lab (formerly the Poverty Lab) conducts rigorous research that expands economic opportunity for those harmed by discrimination, disinvestment, and segregation. We partner with policymakers, community[1]based organizations and others to identify their most urgent and pressing challenges, co[1]generate evidence about what works, and translate findings into policy changes that end intergenerational poverty. One of five Urban Labs based at the Harris School of Public Policy, the Inclusive Economy Lab is led by Pritzker Director Marianne Bertrand, Chris P. Dialynas Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the Booth School of Business. The Inclusive Economy Lab studies programs and policies that aim to expand economic opportunity in order to understand how well they work. By identifying barriers to social mobility and racial equity and highlighting the programs and policies that have the most positive impact, our work creates greater economic opportunity in cities.

We specialize in evaluating programs with the potential to improve lives in four main areas:

College and Career Success
Housing Stability
Financial Security
