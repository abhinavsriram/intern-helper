Position Description The rich history of African American people, cultures, and communities in Essex County,Massachusetts runs deep. This history is embedded in the cultural landscape, fromcemeteries to a renamed park in honor of two famed 19th century black abolitionists. EssexCounty residents, archivists, educators, interpreters, historians, and scholars alike have beenworking to unearth this history and recover these fascinating stories in order to provide afuller account of the county's past and present. In a span of nearly four hundred years, Blackpeople have shaped and been shaped by Essex County. However, real challenges, historicand contemporary, have thwarted the efforts of even the most enterprising and well-trainedexperts because much of this history is hidden, scattered or misplaced. And therein lies theopportunity and need that must be met. Because this history is hidden, residents andtourists alike fail to appreciate the fundamental role African Americans have played in thehistory of Essex County. In 2020, the two-year, grant-funded report, The African AmericanExperience in Essex County, Massachusetts: An Annotated Guide, was completed. Thepurpose of the report is to identify, locate, and compile the collections and resources,organizations, and individuals concerning the Black experience in Essex County. Our twoNational Park Service units in Essex County have sought to implement an inclusive,audience-centered interpretative approach that more prominently features the stories ofAfrican Americans. The report synthesizes key themes and offers suggestions for projectsand serves as a basis for developing historically sound, inclusive programming, fromexhibitions to school projects. African Americans and people of African descent stand tall inEssex County's past, present, and future. There are a wide range of stories and accounts ofBlack women in these collections and repositories. However, there is no singular ""Blackwoman's” story to be told. The intern would work within a theme of the diverse ways inwhich Black women built lives, careers, and families, as well as fought for change, survivedand resisted oppression, and spoke out boldly for themselves and others. The intern willresearch African American women of Essex County who operated within and outside ofsystems that were intended to reduce or limit them; Black women who were leaders ineducation, in business, in civic life, in family life, in activism. The research will focus on boththe names that are well-known and the countless women whose names history hasforgotten, but who nevertheless built and fueled the culture of Essex County for generations.In the ""Recommendations” section of the report, these are a few of the women suggested tobe researched: Charlotte Forten (Salem State University), Rose Lovejoy (Andover), FrancesCole Lee (Haverhill Public Library), Myrna Mitchell Brown (Lawrence), Sarah Remond (PhillipsLibrary), Juno Larcom (Historic Beverly), Agnes (Marblehead), and Sara Baro Colcher(Topsfield). While there are few complete collections of Black women's archival materials,African American women are not completely absent in the historical records. An exhibitcould make this explicit. Suggested ways an intern could tell the stories of the hundreds ofBlack women who have lived in Essex County who did not leave behind personal materials inthe archives include:
Using names from Massachusetts Vital Records and selecting somefrom Essex County to trace through Marriage, Births, and Deaths;
telling the story of Blackwomen who had accounts at the Salem Savings Bank using the records available throughthe Salem State University Archives; and
giving voice to the stories of Black women who were incarcerated at Essex County Jail. The intern will be responsible for researching,planning, drafting, and proposing an exhibit for the Salem Armory Visitor Center that couldalso travel to historic sites and museums in Essex County. Qualifications The intern should ideally be working toward a graduate degree in history or a related field, and have course work, experience, or interest in African American history, public history, education, and/or interpretation. The intern must have strong oral and written communication skills and some experience in working in the archives and/or at museum/historic site settings.

About Words Beats & Life, Inc.
Founded in 2002, Words Beats & Life (WBL) transforms individuals and whole communities through the core elements of hip-hop culture. At the heart of all that we do is the belief that hip-hop can serve as the necessary filter between hope and despair for the youth of the District of Columbia. WBL accomplishes its goals through two main program areas—The Words Beats & Life Academy and The Cipher. The Words Beats & Life Academy is a pre-vocational, arts-based youth development program for youth and young adults. The Cipher is a growing resource for our ever-expanding network of hip-hop based organizations, which equips organizational leaders with the tools and experiences necessary to build sustainable communities. It is our organization’s larger mission to set a high standard in arts education and presentations for youth and emerging artists.

About the Academy
The Words Beats & Life Academy utilizes hip-hop culture as a vehicle for positive youth development to foster the engagement of a new generation of artists and scholars thereby developing the necessary hard and soft skills to support extended learning, employability, self-actualization. At WBL, we feel that hip-hop is the ideal means for creative expression to break the cycle of hopelessness because the history and culture is rooted in the community itself. We validate the students by valuing hip-hop culture. Through the development of intergenerational relationships rooted in hip-hop culture, Academy staff work closely with the students as coaches and mentors. These relationships allow the teaching artists to share their talents and skills as a means of increasing the students cognitive, communication, and interpersonal skills. The target age group we work with is 13-22, but we do make exceptions for younger artists. WBL is committed to producing learning journeys through hip-hop that lead Academy students to succeed in our five focus areas: Skill Mastery, Employability, and Post-Secondary Education, Community and Self Mastery.

Research and Dissemination Summer Intern 2021,The Primary School,"San Francisco, CA","About The Organization

The Primary School is expanding the boundaries of traditional education. Our holistic model weaves together education, health, and family support services to ensure underserved children have the system of care they need to lead meaningful and emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy lives. The Primary School was founded in 2015, supported by seed funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a major national philanthropy.

Our Approach Has Three Defining Characteristics
We start early. We start working with parents and enroll children into our program as early as 12 months to reach them at their most critical stage in development.
We work with - not around - families. We know that parents and caregivers are the most important people in a child's life. We partner with them to enhance the education and health of their children.
We integrate multiple systems to serve the whole child. Our unique model unites health care and education, building a multi-disciplinary team and holistic system of care around a child's full needs.

In 2016, we opened our flagship school in East Palo Alto, California, with our first class of four-year-olds. We have grown to serve over 300 children and their families via a 0-3 parent/child program, a preschool and elementary school, and a parent wellness program.

Our ultimate goal is to create a game-changing system of care for children that can be replicated across the country. To that end, we are building a model that can be effectively implemented in diverse communities and sustained on public funding. In 2020 we expanded our student and family population in East Palo Alto and opened our next site in Hayward, California. In 2021, we will be piloting our Bridge to Preschool program in San Francisco for the first time. It's an exciting time to join the team!

About The Role

The Primary School internship program is a paid summer internship for current undergraduate/ graduate students interested in exploring nonprofit management careers at the intersection of education, health and family support. During the 10-12 week program, interns engage in hands-on, project-based learning, and also participate in high-impact developmental and networking programming. This includes opportunities to build meaningful relationships with other interns, TPS staff, and the broader TPS family and East Palo Alto/San Francisco community.

The Partnerships and Dissemination Intern will work closely with our Research, Design, Dissemination and Policy team, as well as our Birth to Three team and our San Francisco partners. As the Partnerships and Dissemination Intern , you will focus on our early childhood work in San Francisco, and help our team execute on pilot programs, and capture learning and codify practices as we look to influence sites, agencies, and systems with our model. You will also participate in learning and design sessions with our SF team and partner agencies around early intervention, social-emotional learning, early childhood mental health, and family engagement. You will gain experience in program codification and project management. You will also work with our data team to collect, analyze, present, and facilitate usage of data. This is a great opportunity for a student seeking to learn more about program execution and policy work in early education, and what it looks like to partner with different stakeholders to accomplish our goals.

Responsibilities
Support with documenting learning from partnership projects, including Bridge to Preschool in San Francisco
Participate in partnership meetings with various stakeholders in San Francisco's ECE ecosystem
Interview stakeholders and present findings from partner programs
Collaborate with our program teams to codify our partnership and dissemination process

Background

The ‘Education Plus’ initiative is a new, high-profile initiative to accelerate actions and investments to halt and reverse the disproportionate burden due to HIV borne by adolescent girls and young women. It is centered on the empowerment of adolescent girls and young women and the achievement of gender equality in sub-Saharan Africa - with secondary education as the strategic entry point. The initiative is co-led by UNAIDS, UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA and UNESCO and is focused on driving country-level impact, with champion governments and supported by a wide network of regional bodies and global coalitions and partners.

It responds to the urgent need to effectively address the alarming numbers of adolescent girls and young women acquiring HIV and dying of AIDS, among other threats to their survival, well-being, human rights and fundamental freedoms.

But what really makes the After School Center unique is the second tier. Instead of staffing the program with paid adults or volunteers, high school students are employed. These intensive internships are designed to open teens’ eyes to their own amazing abilities and to awaken them to the joy of leadership, the goodness of earning money, the attainability of a college education, and the transforming power of God’s love.

Star Program Description

Sustaining Technical and Analytic Resources (STAR) is a project of the Public Health Institute (PHI) in partnership with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). STAR is a Global Health talent hub. Through fellowships, internships, and strategic partnerships, STAR supports building the capacity of diverse global health professionals and organizations at all levels to make inclusive, collaborative, and innovative contributions to global health. STAR participants collaborate in the development of systems and tools that strengthen and sustain the local and global health response.

Background

INTERNSHIP DESCRIPTION

The Office of Population and Reproductive Health (PRH) advances and supports voluntary family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) programs worldwide to reduce unintended pregnancy and foster improved reproductive health behaviors. PRH provides strategic direction, global technical leadership and support to field programs; ensures responsiveness to Congressional and Administration priorities, directives and restrictions; and provides information on USAID’s family planning and reproductive health programs to a range of stakeholders.

Introduction

PRH identifies youth as an important priority population that requires specific attention so as to achieve the goals of GH’s signature initiatives, including FP2030, and Controlling the AIDS Epidemic and Preventing Child and Maternal Deaths (PCMD). The Service Delivery Improvement Division develops and applies innovative strategies that improve the performance of individuals, organizations and systems for the sustainable delivery of quality voluntary family planning and reproductive health services, including for young people. The Division has multiple global projects and strategic initiatives that combined, seek to strengthen health systems that improve family planning and health outcomes by increasing access to and use of high-quality voluntary family planning and health services, and products in the public and private sectors, delivered by trained, qualified health providers, community health workers, and social and behavior change communication agents.

PRH supports programming with youth as a population segment (10-29 years) and also as a period of life where important healthy behaviors are established for life. PRH supports activities that aim specifically to improve FP/RH information and services specifically for youth. Such activities can ensure youth and families have access to scientifically accurate information regarding puberty, respectful and equal relationships, reproduction, sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, preparation for future families and parenting, and voluntary family planning. Activities can also improve access to high-quality voluntary FP/RH services, address barriers to care-seeking, and work with health care providers to improve their ability to provide client-centered care to youth. Activities can also help youth advocate for themselves, become leaders in their communities to promote access for youth to FP/RH education and services or provide pathways to youth becoming professionals in the FP/RH field.

Reporting Structure

The Intern will work closely with the PRH/SDI Youth Team, reporting daily to the Sr. Youth Advisor or the Youth and Reproductive Health Advisor to plan, organize and coordinate tasks in the scope of work, and to engage closely in the daily work of the youth team. The Intern will receive technical guidance from the SDI Deputy Division Chief, who will serve as their Point of Contact.

OUTCOMES

By the end of the internship, the Intern will have gained experience and exposure to:
Enhanced technical expertise in family planning and reproductive health, specifically as it pertains to young people.
Experience in conducting program review, analysis, and preparation of a database of current FP/RH programming in up to 24 USAID PRH priority countries (e.g., desk review of USAID documents, select key informant interviews, review of themes).
Experience planning, managing, and guiding youth FP/RH activities in a team environment alongside USAID colleagues.


Essential Duties
Provide support and input to the coordination of FP/RH and other integrated youth activities and events.
Review, analyze and synthesize information about existing youth FP/RH programs in USAID priority countries, using the thematic review or other methodology developed with other youth team members.
Develop and populate an excel or Google-based database, or another similar tool, for youth programs by country and for key youth programming resources that can be updated annually.
Create a slide deck summary and analysis of programs reviewed.
Develop a follow-up survey instrument for key informant interviews with youth POCs or activity managers, to gain more insight into key features of ongoing successful youth FP/RH programming.
Review documents, technical writing products, or success stories from the various FP/RH activities managed by PRH and Missions with a youth focus in order to keep the Youth Team and PRH/GH as a whole abreast of youth-related accomplishments.
Keep abreast of new tools and resources related to youth FP/RH programming.
Participate in relevant team, division and office level meetings and events. The supervisor will provide opportunities for select technical training and topical webinars.


Anticipated Learning Outcomes

All STAR Interns will participate in learning activities (*approximately 10% time) during their internship. By the end of the internship, the Intern will be able to:
Gain exposure to FP/RH Programming and PRH Youth Activities through global health programming.
Apply effective communication skills across a broad network of peers and advisors within global health to support learning and professional development.

Job Description

The Role

Since 1993, the Getty Marrow Undergraduate Internship Program has provided substantive, full-time work opportunities to 3,200 undergraduates, exposing them to potential careers in the arts. Aiming to encourage greater diversity in the professions related to museums and the visual arts, the program funds internships at cultural organizations across Los Angeles, including at the Getty Center and the Getty Villa. The Foundation's support enables organizations to host students in full-time, paid internships for ten weeks during the summer.

The internships are intended for outstanding students who are members of groups underrepresented in careers related to museums and the visual arts. Students gain experience in key areas such as curatorship, conservation, education, publications, and related programmatic activities. Candidates are sought from all areas of undergraduate study and are not required to have demonstrated a previous commitment to the visual arts.

American Art Internship

The American Art Intern will work closely with supervisor Dennis Carr, the Virginia Steele Scott Chief Curator of American Art, on two major projects that delve deeply into themes of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The first is a reinstallation of seven permanent collection American Art galleries in the fall of 2021, organized under the theme of “Borderlands,” which seeks to reimagine the American art collection through a DEI lens, to expand the scope of the presentation to represent a more hemispheric view of the Americas, and to introduce new voices into the galleries, including the Huntington’s current artists-in-residence, Enrique Martínez Celaya and Sandy Rodriguez, and student filmmakers from the Ghetto Film School. The second project involves assisting in the development of a major exhibition on the African American artist Sargent Claude Johnson, a key West Coast modernist whose works are represented at the Huntington. The Getty Marrow Undergraduate Intern will also have exposure to many aspects of the exhibition planning and development process working within the Art Division, as well as with colleagues from across the Huntington. Creating and managing checklists, pursuing object research, and potential writing projects will all be part of the intern’s experiences, as well as hands-on work with artworks in the galleries as permitted

DHA-Monitoring Biscayne's Reef-fish Community Intern,Greening Youth Foundation,"Homestead, FL","Program Overview

The need for preserving all of our nation's history has never been greater, and we're counting on you!HBCUI (Historically Black Colleges and Universities Internship)is an 10-week summer experience brought to you byGreening Youth Foundationin partnership with theU.S. National Park Service. As a part of HBCUI 2021, students from schools around the country are putting their unique skills and talents to work in preserving the contributions of African Americans to our nation's history and culture. Participants gain real-world, on-the-job experience as they explore federal careers in the U.S. National Park Service.

POSITION OVERVIEW Position Title DHA-Monitoring Biscayne's Reef-fish Community Intern NPS Unit Name Biscayne National Park Position Dates May 10,2021-July 31,2021 DHA The DHA Resource Assistant internship (DHA-RA) is a unique internship opportunity within the Department of the Interior (DOI). The objective is to build a pathway to employment in the DOI for exemplary students in higher education. DHA-RA interns will apply content expertise to NPS management and build a network with federal employees throughout the internship. These rigorous internships require specialized expertise and typically are available to upper-level undergraduate or graduate students or recent graduates. The internships are designed to develop the participant's technical and creative thinking abilities, leadership skills, and problem-solving capabilities. Successful completion of the internship does not guarantee that the participant will be hired into a federal position.
To be eligible for a DHA--RA Internship, applicants must be a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent legal resident (""green-card-holder”) and enrolled or within one year of graduating from an institution of higher education.
DHA-RA interns who successfully complete the internship requirements become eligible for two years from the date of their degree to be non-competitively hired by the Department of Interior. Position Description .This internship will support the park’s efforts to monitor sensitive reef fish resources. The intern will be expected to be a major contributor to the completion of reef fish surveys at 100 or more reef sites in the park. These reef fish surveys have been completed since 1999, and as such, provide an excellent mechanism to track trends in distribution, abundances, and sizes of reef fish in Biscayne. Furthermore, in light of declining fisheries resources in the park, more stringent fishing regulations were implemented in July of 2020, and thus, the completion of reef fish surveys over the next few years will be critical to assess if the new regulations are effective at helping to restore reef-fish populations. To complete surveys, the intern will work as part of a four-person team of SCUBA divers. At each site, the team will descend to the reef and collect data on the species present, as well as the numbers and size range of each species. Additionally, a rapid habitat assessment will be completed. Following field work, the intern will be expected to enter all data into the online database system in a timely fashion. As a DHA intern, the individual will be required to complete analyses of the abundance and size distributions for a suite of five targeted species. The intern will be expected to have all data used for this effort compiled into a well-organized Excel spreadsheet. Graphics (which could include histograms and maps) would be produced and would also be saved on the park’s servers for later access. This work completed by the DHA intern will be a critical step towards park management being able to evaluate the efficacy of newly implemented fishing regulations which seek to increase the sizes and abundances of targeted fish species by 20% over baseline conditions. Learning Goal The intern will master a reef fish resource monitoring method that is utilized across the entire Florida reef tract from the Dry Tortugas to Martin County. The intern will gain solid experience working as a scientific diver and collecting data under a variety of environmental conditions. The intern will be exposed to scientific methods as well as fishery management topics. Mastery of Florida’s reef fish identification is also expected as a result of this internship. Qualifications .The applicant must be SCUBA certified from an accredited SCUBA diving organization (such as PADI or NAUI). Preference will be given to applicants with an active AAUS Scientific Dive authorization at their current institution. If the applicant has the basic SCUBA certification but not the AAUS certification, he/she will be required to become certified as an NPS diver, which includes a written exam, comprehensive dive physical, and various in-water skills tests, including demonstrating basic skills and swimming extended distances. If you do not feel you could successfully complete these tasks, please do not apply. Ability to identify reef fish of Florida is ideal, but not required (and can be provided during the first weeks of the internship as needed). The intern must be comfortable working on boats, and must NOT be prone to seasickness. Working conditions will involve field days in the intense heat and humidity of south Florida, and being submerged underwater for as much as five hours total each day. Thus, the applicant should be comfortable working in these conditions
Participants must be a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent legal resident ( ""green-card-holder) and currently enrolled in an undergraduate, graduate, or Ph.D. degree program at an accredited institution of higher education during the summer internship.

Additional Qualifications
Must be currently enrolled or recent graduate of an accredited HBCU institution
Must be between 16 and 30years of age
Must be U.S. citizen, U.S. permanent resident or U.S. national

Work Environment This position will be heavily field-based. The intern can expect that in any given 5-day field week, at least 3, and more likely 4, will be field-based (all weather-dependent, of course). Field work will be completed from small boats and underwater. During the summer, water temperatures are quite pleasant and seas are usually calm. Office-based activities will center around data entry. Vehicle/License Requirement A personal vehicle is needed. Compensation and Benefits
Compensation is at a rate of $12.50 per hour, 40 hours per week.
Mandatory attendance in the all-expense-paid Leadership & Careers Workshop
