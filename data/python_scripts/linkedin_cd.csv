Volunteer: Curriculum Development Summer Internship,Robotics for All,"Palo Alto, CA","Founded in April 2017 and officially incorporated in July 2018, Robotics for All aims to bridge close the opportunity gap by providing equitable educational opportunities to students of all backgrounds, particularly underrepresented and underserved students. Our organization previously only provided in-person classes. In July 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned our program to an online setting and experienced breakneck growth. In just 5 months, we taught the same number of students as we did in our first 3 years of operations. Our current online classes are for K-8 grader and teach a variety of platforms including Code.org, Scratch, and Python.

Robotics for All is volunteer-based, with currently over 100 volunteers at the time of writing. Our volunteers hail from dozens of states across the United States and several other countries. We encourage you to apply to join our growing community of volunteers.
Across the country, millions of students lack the resources to learn about STEM and computer science. Our non-profit organization, Robotics for All, strives to provide this vital area of education to underprivileged students through engaging online classes.

Robotics for All is seeking volunteer curriculum development interns for this summer (2021). As a summer intern, you will earn service hours while developing critical communication, organization, and leadership skills, all of which will assist you in varying areas of interest. Interns work in helping to develop one of two new curricula Data Science in Python or Sustainability and Climate Change.

If you are interested in joining our team, please read the full position description and apply by April 31st with the following link https //www.roboticsforall.net/summer-internship.html. Late applications will not be accepted.

We look forward to engineering the future with you!
