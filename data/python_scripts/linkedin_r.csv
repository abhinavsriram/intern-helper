Research Intern - Research Assistant,Microsoft,"Redmond, WA","Virtual Internship

Participation in the Research Internship Program requires that you are physically located in the United States or Canada for the duration of the internship

Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

Many physicists have wondered how the universe chooses its basic laws. One idea is that the laws-or the parameters that characterize them, such as the masses of the different quarks and leptons, can evolve in time. Several mechanisms have been proposed, which can be visualized as a point representing the universe moving on a vast landscape of possible laws. This turns out to be a process that can be efficiently simulated by a deep neural network. We continue our work started in 2020 building and running models to investigate this and other ideas about how the universe chose or learnt its laws. Project co-led by Microsoft researcher Jaron Lanier, Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and Stephon Alexander of Brown University.

G-4 Visas For Interns

All interns assigned to a UN Organization, including Funds and Programmes, at a United States based duty station, who are not United States citizens or United States legal permanent residents (LPR) will be required to obtain G-4 visas prior to travelling to the United States.

Prospective interns who are already in the United States in another nonimmigrant status may need to apply for a change of status to G-4 prior to joining the United Nations for an internship. It should be emphasized that prospective interns are responsible for ensuring that they have an appropriate valid visa and employment authorization allowing them to undertake the internship.

If the applicant is in F-1 status and has a valid EAD, they may undertake an internship within the scope of their F-1 visa without seeking a change of visa status. Please note, however, that interns in F-1 status who wish to undertake an internship following completion of their academic programme as part of Optional Practical Training (OPT) ‘may’ need to seek a change of visa status to G-4 (This process currently takes about 8-10 weeks) or obtain G-4 visa overseas.

To qualify for G-4 nonimmigrant status, interns must be serving essentially full-time, i.e. 35 + hours per week.

Remote Internship (covid-19)

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, applicants may be requested to undertake the internship remotely in view of constraints regarding visa issuance, international travel and access to UN premises. Applicants must be willing and prepared to undertake the internship remotely for a part or the entirety of the internship.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.
