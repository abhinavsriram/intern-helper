Research Intern - Research Assistant,Microsoft,"Redmond, WA","Virtual Internship

Participation in the Research Internship Program requires that you are physically located in the United States or Canada for the duration of the internship

Research Internships at Microsoft provide a dynamic environment for research careers with a network of world-class research labs led by globally-recognized scientists and engineers. Our researchers and engineers pursue innovation in a range of scientific and technical disciplines to help solve complex challenges in diverse fields, including computing, healthcare, economics, and the environment.

Many physicists have wondered how the universe chooses its basic laws. One idea is that the laws-or the parameters that characterize them, such as the masses of the different quarks and leptons, can evolve in time. Several mechanisms have been proposed, which can be visualized as a point representing the universe moving on a vast landscape of possible laws. This turns out to be a process that can be efficiently simulated by a deep neural network. We continue our work started in 2020 building and running models to investigate this and other ideas about how the universe chose or learnt its laws. Project co-led by Microsoft researcher Jaron Lanier, Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, and Stephon Alexander of Brown University.
