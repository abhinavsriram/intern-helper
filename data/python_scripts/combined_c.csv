Remote Marketing and Communications Internships,Virtual Internships,Anywhere,"Why Complete a Remote Marketing Opportunity?

Around the global, marketing can take on analytical and business roles of planning budgets, ad spends, forecasting return on investment and more as well as the creative side of advertising, social media, campaign management and more. Both focuses are delivered through specific departments across industries or in specific marketing agencies or consultancies. Supporting marketing as a virtual intern is so much more than delivering a social media campaign and can include research and analysis, design and creativity, content development, and project management.

Think about how many advertisements you come across in your day to day life - including channels like

TV, radio, podcasts, and physical ads all around your town. This last area is greatly enhanced if you live in a city, where advertisements can be found on billboards, trains, buses, benches, in windows - you name it! In fact some cities like New York City and Tokyo have built their “image” off of the vast array of public advertisements in their metro areas. Any company that wants to sell a good or service has to find creative and intriguing ways to market it, and major corporations are more than willing to spend millions and, in some cases billions, on top-notch ad campaigns, market research, and creative teams. Those interested in getting their feet wet in the vast industries of creative marketing, advertising, SEO, and brand awareness will find great opportunity with Virtual Internships. Our host companies seek to market everything from wellness supplements, to makeup, to electric cars, to KPop concerts, to cultural tours, and so much more!

Sample Placements
• Support a UK based recruitment agency to work closely with the UK Country Manager to design sales pitches, such as videos, for the purpose of stakeholders' engagement; Develop relationships with key stakeholders, both internal and external, in the UK, Spain and Italy.
• Support a US based tech manufacturing company to create and manage digital input for social media platforms and monitor/report on engagement on a weekly basis; Create new case studies and marketing materials and presentations

The City of Tacoma
Tacoma is a mid-sized urban port city that sits along the Puget Sound with a population of nearly 210,000. The third largest city in the state of Washington, it is a diverse, progressive international gateway to the Pacific Rim.

Propelled by significant developments such as the University of Washington Tacoma, the Tacoma Link light rail system, the restored urban waterfront of the Thea Foss Waterway, the expansions of both the MultiCare and Franciscan health systems, and a significant influx of foreign direct investment in its downtown core, Tacoma has evolved considerably since the 1990s.

Tacoma boasts the state's highest density of art and history museums, and is home to a flourishing creative community of writers, artists, musicians, photographers, filmmakers, chefs, entrepreneurs, and small business owners who each add their unique flair to the city's vibrant commercial landscape. The iconic Tacoma Dome has endured as a high-demand venue for some of the largest names in the entertainment industry.

A magnet for families looking for affordable housing options in the Puget Sound area, Tacoma also draws those who prefer to live in a more urban downtown setting with competitively priced condos and apartments that feature panoramic mountain and water views.

Tacoma's natural beauty and proximity to the Puget Sound and Mount Rainier draws hikers, runners, bicyclists, and maritime enthusiasts to the area. Its lively social scene is infused with energy by thousands of students attending the University of Washington Tacoma, the University of Puget Sound, the Evergreen State College Tacoma campus, and Tacoma Community College, as well as a number of local trade and technical colleges. Its prime location - just 20 minutes south of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, 30 miles north of the state capital in Olympia, and within 10 miles of the U.S. Department of Defense's premier military installation on the West Coast - only adds to Tacoma's desirability.
