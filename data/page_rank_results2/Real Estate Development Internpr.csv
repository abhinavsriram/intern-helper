11,"Summer Development Intern","Cross Street Partners LLC","Baltimore, MD","Company Profile
Cross Street Partners (CSP) is a vertically integrated real estate company with expertise in development, financial advisory, construction, and property management. CSP is dedicated to reinvigorating America’s cities through creative, community-centered development. We are the lead developers or co-developers of several large-scale adaptive reuse and neighborhood revitalization projects, including Baltimore Penn Station (Baltimore, MD), Perkins Somerset Oldtown (Baltimore, MD) and Dayton Arcade (Dayton, OH).
 This internship is a unique opportunity to get hands-on real estate development experience at a relatively small company. We are busy, and as a result the intern will have meaningful responsibilities and work directly with people in leadership positions. Additionally, because we undertake many of our projects in partnership with other developers, the intern will likely get exposure to a number of companies in addition to Cross Street Partners.
 How We Work
CSP focuses on rebuilding urban communities by creating vibrant mixed-use neighborhoods. We set our sights on vacant or underutilized historically-significant buildings and repurpose them with forward-thinking use plans focused on placemaking, innovation and community development. CSP develops projects for its own account and also serves as a consultant to non-profits or entrepreneurs with a real estate vision.
 Wherever we work, our goals are the same: to finance, develop, build, and manage authentic environments that inspire collaboration, spur innovation, and sustain community connection.
 Responsibilities
CSP currently has exciting development projects in Baltimore, MD, Cambridge, MD, Dayton, OH and Winston Salem, NC. The CSP team is looking to hire a highly motivated summer intern to support these projects. Responsibilities will include:

Project Support
The intern will support one or more active development projects, taking on responsibilities related to feasibility/financial analysis, task management, financing, use program development, and leasing/marketing. Ultimately, the intern’s responsibilities will be driven by the status of the company’s development projects during the internship experience.
Organizational Design
intern will work with the team to identify and address areas for organizational improvement across the company.
Special Project
summer, we identify a specific project that the intern can take the lead on and “own.” We typically suggest a few ideas, and the intern selects one based on his/her interests and experience.
 Qualifications
Relevant experience in real estate, planning or a related field.
A four-year college degree and active enrollment in an advance degree program in business administration, real estate, urban planning, public policy, architecture, law, or another related field. Real life experience can substitute for a college degree and/or enrollment in an advanced degree program.
More important than these qualifications is a passion for cities, community development, green building and historic preservation.
 Employment Terms
This is an hourly position located at our offices in Baltimore City. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, this internship will likely involve both in-person and virtual components. We prefer that the intern work 40 hours per week for approximately 10 weeks beginning in mid-May. However, we will also consider applicants who are only available on a part-time basis.
 Compensation depends on the applicant’s qualifications and experience. 
 Cross Street Partners LLC is an equal opportunity employer.
 How To Apply
