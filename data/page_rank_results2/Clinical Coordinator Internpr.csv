About ClinEd Telehealth:

ClinEd Telehealth strives to revolutionize the clinical education experience by aligning student learning experience with 21st century, healthcare practice. When academic programs adopt an integrated and experiential approach to clinical education using telehealth learning technologies, students learn in ways that are more closely aligned with and reflect contemporary practice in the nursing and allied health fields. Our educational model diversifies clinical education into four categories: Synchronous Telehealth, Asynchronous Telehealth, in-clinic training (traditional, hands-on patient care), and service learning (using the learned skills relevant to your course of study, to provide community service.)

We recognize that the healthcare and education industries must adapt to the ever-changing world in which we live. With clarity, we acknowledge that the Covid-19 had a significant impact on student placement and prior to the Pandemic, our clinical education pathways were over-stressed. As we move forward during these unprecedented times, we must do so with foresight. It is likely site coordinators and clinical instructors will be unable to provide equal educational access and availability to all students in a timely manner. As such, our goal is to help decompress these systems now by providing an alternative pathway for clinical education completion; keeping students, programs, and institutions on-track and on-time, with their outcomes and goals.

Our overarching mission is to be a change agent in healthcare and education by making both accessible and affordable to all. The patients we serve either have no insurance, have exhausted their insurance benefits or have insurance but simply cannot afford the co-payments and deductibles of their plans. Our model is designed to meet the needs of both students and patients, providing a “win-win” situation for everyone. Students are able to fulfill their clinical educational hours, allowing them to graduate on-time and obtain professional licensure, while patients receive the necessary, high-quality care that they need but simply cannot afford or do not have.

The time has come to re-imagine how we approach clinical education and meeting the needs of underserved populations within our community, country and world. Out of necessity and especially during these unprecedented times, we must have the courage to act; taking the utmost responsibility to uphold each professions core values and standards of care. ClinEd Telehealth is proud to bring forward this groundbreaking solution for healthcare scholars and for those that are in need of high-quality, healthcare.
