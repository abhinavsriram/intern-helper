About Clara Foods™

Clara Foods™ is a Bay Area venture capital-backed company working towards a disruptive advance in food technology by producing animal proteins without the animal using fermentation. We join a new generation of entrepreneurs, activists and scientists who recognize that the decades-old factory farm model cannot sustain the dietary needs of 7 billion people and counting - and that technology may hold a solution.

As much as the growing market demands for animal protein production exert pressure on food producers to improve their efficiencies and outputs, there is also growing public distaste for the environmental, animal welfare, and health compromises of industrial-scale animal agriculture.

Clara Foods™ aims to subvert this moral and economic deadlock by taking the animal out of the equation. We’re bringing products to the table that are produced completely animal-free, use less land and water inputs, while matching the taste, nutritional value, and unique culinary properties of animal proteins.","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/2430058828?url=https%3A%2F%2Frecruiting%2Eadp%2Ecom%2Fsrccsh%2Fpublic%2FRTI%2Ehome%3Fr%3D5000620310506%26c%3D1208301%26d%3DExternal%26rb%3DLINKEDIN&urlHash=uHVF&refId=55f98d16-f536-43e3-93ee-867e15e8df5c&trackingId=nKZMrF9rCR5K%2FzTjsJbs7A%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_apply-link-offsite",0.008436818174132612,
