United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

NeueHouse is the private workspace and cultural home for creators, innovators, and thought leaders. With iconic buildings, timeless design, thought-provoking cultural experiences, and elevated hospitality, NeueHouse has reimagined the ideal environment for creative potential and progress.

Our Properties

NeueHouse currently operates across three different, but equally iconic properties in New York City and Los Angeles
Our Madison Square (MSQ) House is situated in New York’s iconic Flatiron District, was previously home for Tepper Galleries, a well-known Manhattan auction house for international artists and collectors in the 1930s – and neighbors the 69th Regiment Armory where the first International Exhibition of Modern Art was held.
Our Hollywood House (HWD), which sits on Sunset Boulevard, is one of LA’s most celebrated buildings and occupies the original CBS Studio (the world’s first structure built intentionally for broadcast). Here genre- defining artists from Orson Wells and Lucille Ball, to Janis Joplin, the Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan built their legacy.
Our Bradbury House (BB) sits within the Bradbury building in DTLA. Built in 1893, the Bradbury Building is an architectural masterpiece and one of Los Angeles’ most historic landmarks. It has been heralded as one of the most thrilling spaces in all of North America and is renowned for its breathtaking skylit atrium filled with walkways, stairs, balconies, and intricate ironwork.

These properties are complemented by forthcoming houses in Venice Beach, and Miami, as well as proposed European locations. Regardless of locale, and by deliberate design, all of our environment and teams support, nurture and connect the NeueHouse community in reaching their creative potential.

The Role

Supporting our dynamic Private Events team, the Events & Programming internship is a phenomenal opportunity to learn, hands-on, what it takes to support a multi-million-dollar sales function.

The internship requires a 25 – 30 hour weekly commitment over three months, is paid, and does have the potential to become a permanent role under the appropriate circumstances.

Requirements

Creative, culturally connected, and comfortable working in the detail, the Events & Programming internship will require someone who is ready to
Support in email, phone and in-person communication for prospective members and event clients
Coordinate and schedule property and event space tours for prospective members and event clients
Support the development of live music series, screening series-support, project management of planning of Super Bowl 2022

Develop documents of surrounding residential buildings + businesses for potential Membership or Event Sales outreach
Support the Event Sales team with payment collection reminders for external clients

The ACLU-NC's Legal-Policy Department invites law students to apply for its Democracy & Civic Engagement Internship.

Qualified applicants are enthusiastic, creative, and detail-oriented; have strong research, writing, and oral communication skills; and can articulate a commitment to work for social justice and the ideals of the ACLU.

About The Legal-Policy Department

The Legal-Policy Department pursues cutting edge impact litigation and promotes policy change in order to defend and expand the civil liberties and civil rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. The Department's work focuses on six broad program areas: Criminal Justice; Democracy & Civic Engagement; Gender, Sexuality & Reproductive Justice; Immigrants' Rights; Racial & Economic Justice; and Technology & Civil Liberties. The Department's staff is based in San Francisco, Sacramento, and Fresno, although staff is currently carrying out work remotely due to Covid-19. Department staff work closely with other departments within the ACLU-NC, including Organizing, Communications, Development, Finance & Administration, as well as with the ACLU of California Center for Advocacy and Policy in Sacramento.

Democracy & Civic Engagement Internship

Democracy & Civic Engagement Interns work directly with one or more attorneys in support of the Program's litigation and policy work, which focuses on voting rights, the First Amendment, and open government. Interns are responsible for conducting legal research, as well as for drafting legal memoranda, court documents, pre-litigation demand letters, and public records act requests. Additionally, interns may be asked to investigate facts and possible legal claims arising from intakes received via the Civil Liberties Hotline. When possible, interns will attend appellate arguments, trial proceedings, and depositions. Interns are also encouraged to participate in regular meetings with team members and with Department staff to discuss litigation and policy strategies. At times, assignments may arise that provide interns the opportunity to work across the Department's six broad program areas, including in the areas of Racial and Economic Justice, Technology and Civil Liberties, Criminal Justice, and Immigrants' Rights

Applicants must currently be attending law school. The Legal-Policy Department accepts one Democracy & Civic Engagement Intern per term.

Background

The ‘Education Plus’ initiative is a new, high-profile initiative to accelerate actions and investments to halt and reverse the disproportionate burden due to HIV borne by adolescent girls and young women. It is centered on the empowerment of adolescent girls and young women and the achievement of gender equality in sub-Saharan Africa - with secondary education as the strategic entry point. The initiative is co-led by UNAIDS, UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA and UNESCO and is focused on driving country-level impact, with champion governments and supported by a wide network of regional bodies and global coalitions and partners.

It responds to the urgent need to effectively address the alarming numbers of adolescent girls and young women acquiring HIV and dying of AIDS, among other threats to their survival, well-being, human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Working at Sephora’s Field Support Center (FSC)

Dedicated teams cater to our client’s every need by creating covetable assortments, curated content, compelling storytelling, smart strategy, skillful analysis, expert training, and more. It takes a lot of curious and confident individuals, disrupting the status quo and taking chances. The pace is fast, the fun is furious, and the passion is real. We never rest on our laurels. Our motto? If it’s not broken, fix it.

Sephora is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, marital status, military/veteran status, or disability status. Sephora is committed to working with and providing reasonable accommodation to applicants with physical and mental disabilities.

 POSITION
The Institute is seeking Interns to contribute to its new program on rights and liberties.

 RESPONSIBILITIES
 Interns will engage in research concerning rights and liberties. For any given right that is studied, we seek to understand a number of more granular questions, such as:
Differing approaches to the right in different cultures or political regimes
The ideas or events that led to the right being considered a right
Conceptions of the role of the right in the wider state and society
Conceptions of potential limitations of the right
Policy recommendations concerning the right

But around the globe, persistent poverty, repression, and injustice prevent too many people form achieving their full potential.

This program connects entrepreneurs from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada with U.S.-based businesses, start-ups, and organizations for a six-week fellowship. The intern supporting this team will focus primarily on the host organization placement process to match YLAI entrepreneurs with U.S.-based businesses doing similar work for an in-person or virtual fellowship. Other duties may be assigned as needed to support virtual curriculum development and/or event planning.

We are doers. Our decades of on-the-ground experience help us create greater impact, practical recommendations, and lasting partnerships.
