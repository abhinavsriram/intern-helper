United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs.

Help manage CNET's flagship accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Familiarity with newsgathering and reporting, AP Style and other principles of journalism.
An interest in the intersection between technology and all other parts of life — you'll be bored if things like the impact of algorithms on labor movements or what makes a new iPhone unique don't excite you.

44,"Social Media Marketing Intern","PathMatch","Los Angeles Metropolitan Area","Are you interested in a career in Digital Marketing with a focus on Social Media Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing. This matched internship has a larger emphasis on Social Media Marketing. Students will be focused on both organic and paid social.

Most students don’t realize how critical corporate internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing or Social Media Marketing skills in a classroom. Companies look for experience working on live campaigns.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where you'll learn the fundamentals of digital marketing and get matched to an internship with our corporate partner where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.

I was able to add a car magnet, window decal, advertising banners, snap chat filters and so much more to my portfolio after my summer with L&H.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs.

Women are on the cusp of becoming the most powerful force in America. But to fundamentally transform this country, we need to pull together the millions of women who are already engaged and amplify and expand their civic engagement.

We provide women with the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to channel the energy and activism of this moment and build it into a long-term movement for change.

Since our founding in April 2019, Supermajority Education Fund and our related 501(c)(4) organization, Supermajority, have reached more than a million women through in-person conversations and online outreach.

In September and October 2019, the Supermajority Education Fund Bus Tour met up with thousands of women across fourteen states. In December 2019 welcomed Pantsuit Nation, an online community of more than 3 million women and allies, into our organization. In 2020, we ran the country's largest woman-to-woman voter engagement program by offering strategic digital tools, training, and information to women and allies around the country.

44,"Social Media Marketing Intern","PathMatch","Los Angeles Metropolitan Area","Are you interested in a career in Digital Marketing with a focus on Social Media Marketing? Did you know that there are currently 80K open Digital Marketing positions with not enough people to fill these open roles? Did you struggle to land a Summer 2021 internship due to a lack of experience or ability to interview? Want to make sure this doesn’t happen next summer?

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week training and real-world internship program for college students looking to break into Digital Marketing. This matched internship has a larger emphasis on Social Media Marketing. Students will be focused on both organic and paid social.

Most students don’t realize how critical corporate internships are to landing jobs until it’s too late. Companies use their Digital Marketing Internship programs as an audition process and hire their best performers. But to land these internships, students need the right skills and experience.

But here’s the issue: You don’t learn Digital Marketing or Social Media Marketing skills in a classroom. Companies look for experience working on live campaigns.

The PathMatch Digital Marketing Accelerator is a 12-week program where you'll learn the fundamentals of digital marketing and get matched to an internship with our corporate partner where you’ll gain real-world experience and put your training to use. To find out more: https://www.pathmatch.com/accelerator/digital-marketing

NOTE: Due to the training curriculum and guaranteed internship through our company matching platform, these programs cost students $3,999 (we offer numerous payment options/plans). This is roughly the cost of a course at your university, but far more valuable. You’ll be matched to a paid internship ($15/hr- you'll essentially make most of the program fee back) where you’ll be adding an internship and real-world skills to your resume, setting you up for added success in your next internship/job search. You’ll also build your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy (companies start their searches in August) which sets you up for greater success.

The deadline to apply is April 16th. Because these internships are guaranteed, spots are filling up quickly.

WHAT YOU GET: 
Curriculum, online seminars, and events
Guaranteed paid internship placement with continuous support from your coaching team
Resume building and career-defining experience that will increase your chances of landing next year's internship/job
Resume, LinkedIn, and interview preparation
Experience that sets you apart from the competition for internships/jobs
Lifetime access to the PathMatch alumni and coaching network

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING:
In Weeks 1-6 - You’ll learn the basics of digital marketing strategies, learn marketing analytics to help improve campaign performance, and learn how to build and test content for engagement on social media
In Weeks 7-12, you’ll work in a 6-week internship (possibly longer) with a company where you’ll be able to participate in numerous campaigns and see how campaigns are launched and tested
Build your resume - a Digital Marketing internship will increase your chances of landing another internship/job
Revise your resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn Profile
Develop your 2022 Internship/Job Search strategy
Improve your interview skills with mock interview preparation

WHAT YOU NEED:
Have an interest in working in a Digital Marketing role
Full-time summer availability
Pursuing an undergraduate degree
Strong work ethic and open to learning

A BIT ABOUT US:
We’re PathMatch. We exist because the outcomes of college graduates over the past 5-10 years have been horrendous. 63% of employers feel that recent college grads are generally unprepared for the workforce. This is due to the fact that students often lack workplace skills and experience built through internships. There’s a growing skills gap and the only way to close it is to help students understand what companies need so they can prepare. Did you know that in 2019, at the height of the market, 53% of college grads were still unemployed 9 months after graduation? We’re working to change this.
 PathMatch offers tools/tech/content to help students increase their odds of landing internships and jobs in the digital economy. Our 12-week Summer Accelerators help students increase their odds of landing future internships and jobs by 86%. PathMatch students make an extra 10K+ in starting salary due to real-world experience.

Intern Testimonials

“I enjoyed every opportunity and experience that the social media internship at L&H Bridal offered me! I was able to broaden and capitalize on my creative skills in a supportive and independent environment. I also gained new insight in the bridal industry while expanding my social media marketing skills at L&H Bridal. This unique experience will definitely stick with me throughout my future career!” -Gina Kiger (Spring 2019) (Rowan University)

“My time at L&H has been incredibly rewarding. This was my first internship and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience! I learned skills and tips from running these accounts that I will carry with me to wherever I go next. The rest of the staff was incredibly friendly, especially Tony. Plus I got to look at gorgeous wedding dresses all day, who wouldn’t love that? I highly recommend taking this internship whether it’s for-credit or just to get some experience under your belt--you won’t regret it!” -Bridget Neirotti (Fall 2018) (Bucks County Community College)

“My experience at L&H Bridal was nothing but rewarding. I am so lucky to have had the opportunity to intern at such a lovely, family owned boutique. During my internship my main job was to run all L&H bridal, boutique, and RACK’s social media pages, but I also worked on some long-term projects on top of that. I was able to add a car magnet, window decal, advertising banners, snap chat filters and so much more to my portfolio after my summer with L&H. I would defiantly recommend this internship for anyone who is majoring in Fashion merchandising, media, or marketing!” -Victoria Carney (Summer 2018) (Kent State University)

“During my time at L&H Bridal I was able to learn a lot more than I expected such as bridal trends, which was a personal goal of mine. I also had the opportunity to expand my graphic arts skills through making advertisements, signs, and brochures to help market the store. I was very grateful to grow and learn throughout my time interning there.” -Jessica Jones (Spring 2018) (Delaware Valley University)

“My experience with L&H Bridal was incredibly positive. Through the use of different media accounts, I learned the ins and outs of business marketing. I was able to be as creative as possible with collaboration of the L&H team. I was able to put my Communication Studies skills to use as I interacted with the team and online followers. L&H Bridal allowed me to gain the experience I need to further my career with media and marketing.” -Natalie Quinlan (Winter ’16-’17) (Bloomsburg University)

“L&H Bridal’s Social Media Internship allowed me to demonstrate skills I harnessed throughout my academic career. As someone who enjoys creative freedom, I was able to complete assignments with confidence knowing that my vision and opinions would be validated. This position not only gives you a glimpse behind the bridal industry, but also teaches you the importance social media has within a business.” -Lauren Haag (Summer 2016) (Penn State University)

L&H Bridal's social media management internship not only introduced me to a side of the fashion industry that I hadn't explored, but broadened my understanding of a rapidly growing area of the media and communication field. As someone who enjoys diving headfirst into creative projects, I found my position at L&H Bridal to be the perfect blend of independent work and collaborative learning. The hands-on assignments will keep you interested from start to finish, and the social media marketing skills you gain will be invaluable. -Jennifer Retter (Fall 2015) (Arcadia University)
